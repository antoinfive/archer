>> KRIEGER: Okay, specs are all in the green. So, let me just reboot the CPU, and... Beep boop, you are no longer a cripple.
>> RAY: One, two, three, Go Herd.
>> KRIEGER: Well?
>> RAY: Well? Well, you could've done this weeks ago! So it's about goddamn time!
>> KRIEGER: Ooh, hang on a sec? (Ray yells) Yeah, touchy thing, bionics. You were saying?
>> RAY: Thank you.
>> KRIEGER: No, what were you saying like you meant it?
>> RAY: Thank you, Krieger, for once again giving me the precious gift of legs.
>> KRIEGER: You're welcome.
>> RAY: Now, if you will excuse me, I need to remove my underwear with a blowtorch.
>> MALORY: Ha! Perfect, this is absolutely perfect. Cherlene!
>> CYRIL: Ow! God! Come on!
>> LANA: Seriously, thanks for the deaf baby.
>> MALORY: Oh, shut up. Cher...
>> CHERLENE: What?! Goddamn, woman, inside voice!
>> MALORY: How... would you, my little country songbird, like to be on Travis County Limits?
>> CYRIL: Ooh, is that like Austin City Limits?
>> MALORY: It's comparable, hush. Cherlene?
>> CHERLENE: I don't know. I gue .
>> MALORY: You... would be wonderful, and it would be wonderful publicity, and... wonderful. (groans)
>> CHERLENE: All right. When is it?
>> MALORY: Tapes tomorrow night, but we should leave today. I don't want you flying the same day you're performing.
>> CHERLENE: Oh, don't worry about that.
>> MALORY: Well, but...
>> CHERLENE: Because Cherlene don't fly.
>> MALORY: Airplane air is so dry, plus you're breathing in God knows what those tuberculars in coach are... Excuse me?!
>> CHERLENE: I don't fly.
>> MALORY: I... but-but I've seen you fly.
>> CHERLENE: Well, maybe you saw Cheryl fly.
>> LANA: In a helicopter, the space shuttle...
>> PAM: Cyril choke-banged you on a blimp? Oh, come on, we were all thinking it.
>> ARCHER: What, how are you all so goddamn loud?
>> LANA: Could you not find a punch bowl?
>> ARCHER: It was too heavy. (loud crashing nearby) (Woodhouse grunting) (grunting and crashing continues) (groans)
>> ARCHER: And also too spilly. Now, what's with all the yelling?
>> MALORY: I booked Cherlene on Travis County Limits, and...
>> ARCHER: Is that like...?
>> MALORY: It's comparable! But it's tomorrow night and she refuses to fly.
>> ARCHER: Wait, really? So you've only got 24 hours to drive to Texas?
>> MALORY: Well, 36 but...
>> ARCHER: But after we get a bus and a blocker car it'll be 24, right?
>> MALORY: What?
>> LANA: Oh. Oh, God, no.
>> ARCHER: Yes! >> LANA: Archer?
>> ARCHER: Lana!
>> MALORY: Sterling! What are you talking about?
>> LANA: Smokey and the goddamn Bandit.
>> MALORY: What?
>> ARCHER: We're going * Eastbound and down!
>> MALORY: I will never understand his idiotic fascination with all this Burt Reynolds Smokey trucker nonsense.
>> LANA: I think part of it is because you didn't get him that CB McHaul toy truck he wanted for his birthday.
>> MALORY: Wha...? He was 30!
>> LANA: And words fail me. I have no words.
>> ARCHER: How about ten-goddamn-four?!
>> MALORY: How about how much did this cost?
>> CHERLENE: How about a Jacuzzi, bitches? Woooooo!
>> ARCHER: You know what they say-- can't put a price on free advertising.
>> MALORY: No, they don't, and free this isn't.
>> ARCHER: Exactly. How much are they paying Cherlene?
>> MALORY: It's public television, they don't pay anything. All they do is suck money in. They take our taxes...
>> LANA: Or donations, whatever.
>> MALORY: Of pre-tax dollars from pot-taking Bolshevik lesbian couples! Then PBS mixes it all in with their huge N.E.A. grants, launders it in inner-city methadone clinics, and pumps it right back out to pro-abortion, super-PACs!
>> LANA: Still no words. (Pam grunting) And, wow, maybe I have aphasia.
>> MALORY: Where do you think you're going?
>> ARCHER: She's driving the bus. Mother, get on the bus. Lana, you're riding with me.
>> LANA: In what? (tires screeching)
>> ARCHER: In the blocker car, duh, if Cyril didn't just break the stupid axle.
>> MALORY: The what?
>> LANA: Okay, first of all...
>> MALORY: How much did that cost?
>> ARCHER: Well, again, it's advertising, so...
>> MALORY: For what?
>> ARCHER: Hmm, I gue  Pontiac?
>> MALORY: God. >> ARCHER: And where are you going?
>> LANA: Well, speaking for the tiny, delicate life blo oming inside me, nowhere in a car with T-tops and a four-barrel.
>> ARCHER: Wha... Who's gonna do snappy dialogue with me, underscored by sexual attraction? I'm so angry right now I can't even... (sniffs) Oh, goddamn it! Did you fart in that? (Pam laughing)
>> LANA: Damn it, Cyril, slow down!
>> MALORY: Cyril, do nothing of the sort! Because if we mi  that taping, I won't be responsible for my actions.
>> LANA: Are you ever?
>> MALORY: She said, single and pregnant. Oh, wait.
>> CYRIL: Can you two please go... anywhere else? It's bad enough I have to drive 24 hours straight.
>> LANA: Well, Krieger said he needed Ray's help on some sort of project.
>> RAY: This quit being funny two hours ago!
>> KRIEGER: It's not supposed to be funny.
>> MALORY: So shut up and drive the damn bus! Sorry, I'm a bit stre ed out about Cherlene getting a record deal.
>> LANA: Right, and your ten percent of it.
>> MALORY: Or 50 or whatever.
>> LANA: What?
>> CYRIL: 50, really? >> LANA: Who are you, Colonel Mom Parker? Nothing?
>> CYRIL: Meh.
>> MALORY: And not that I care what any of you think, about anything, but I lost everything when the Feds took ISIS, and Ron took what little I had left, so now I need to make it back somehow. And I'm not doing that selling cocaine, thanks to Sterling, who, unbelievably, is even worse at this than at spying.
>> ARCHER: Hey, so... Yeah, hi, uh, I think maybe somebody's holding down the talk-button thingy?
>> CYRIL: Uh... oh! Uh, sorry, Archer.
>> LANA: Exactly the opposite of how it works.
>> CYRIL: What? Oh. Uh, sorry, Archer. (Archer sighs)
>> ARCHER: Ten-ten-four, good buddy.
>> MALORY: Sterling?
>> CYRIL: Well, he can't hear you now, I... ow! Ow! Whose ring is that, the pope's?! >> PAM (laughing): Ouch!
>> ARCHER: Shut up.
>> PAM: Seriously though, I'm sorry you heard her say that. That's got to be a real knee to the old emotional nut sack.
>> ARCHER: Well, I gue  it would be, if A-- I weren't the world's greatest spy.
>> PAM: Eh.
>> ARCHER: Shut up, and B-- if they weren't sitting on a hundred pounds of coke.
>> PAM: What?!
>> ARCHER: Affirmatory, good buddy!
>> PAM: Holy dickburn! So you got a buyer lined up in Texas and everything?!
>> ARCHER: Well, not exactly, or at all, but, Pam, come on. We're talking about Texas. Somebody, somewhere, wants enough cocaine to forget they live there.
>> PAM: Yeah, but not 100 pounds.
>> ARCHER: Maybe we'll get lucky, find an entire town that wants to commit suicide.
>> PAM: Wonder if there's a statewide database of towns with sucky high school football teams cro -indexed with towns a black person just moved to.
>> ARCHER: Jesus, Pam, I was kidding.
>> PAM: (laughs) Duh, me too, lickbag.
>> ARCHER: Well, but see if there is one, just for shits and giggles.
>> PAM: Um, so, hey, speaking of...
>> ARCHER: The hat fart was technically a shart? (laughs) How are you still single?
>> PAM: Right? (chomps) (belches)
>> LANA: Cyril! (Cyril screams)
>> LANA: Goddamn it!
>> CYRIL: I'm-I'm sorry!
>> MALORY: What the hell is going on up here?!
>> CYRIL: I must've dozed off!
>> LANA: Really? You don't just hate signs?
>> CYRIL: No, Lana, I don't ha... Ow!
>> LANA: In addition to sushi, booze, and soft cheeses, I'm also supposed to abstain from bus crashes! So stay awake!
>> CYRIL: I'm trying, but 18 hours? I don't know how Pam's doing it.
>> LANA: Seriously?
>> PAM: Woooooo!! (laughs) (Archer yells)
>> ARCHER: What the...?!
>> PAM: Hey, sleepyhead! Welcome to Texas!
>> ARCHER: Already? What the shit, Pam?!
>> PAM: That's how we do backseat drivers.
>> ARCHER: I was driving!
>> PAM: Yeah, and sucking at it.
>> ARCHER: Goddamn it! How long was I out?
>> PAM: Like, 12 hours? Five states, dozen cupcakes, a bunch of truck stops. >> TRUCKER (over CB): Uh, breaker breaker, you got your ears on, Snowball? Come back.
>> PAM: Hang on.
>> ARCHER: Your handle is Snowball?! Like Jerry Reed's character in the Smokey-verse?!
>> PAM: Who?
>> ARCHER: Oh. Is it from from the cupcake?
>> PAM: Cupcakes? Oh! (laughs) Oh, no.
>> ARCHER: Then what's it...?
>> PAM: Truck stops... are crazy awesome! This is Snowball, good buddy.
>> TRUCKER: You might wanna check your six, Snowball.
>> ARCHER: Ew, is that about the shart?!
>> PAM: Wha...? No, lickbag!
>> ARCHER: It was a reasonable a umption.
>> PAM: What the...?
>> TRUCKER: Looks like you got a chain gang knocking on your back door.
>> ARCHER: Bikers? What the hell do they want?
>> CYRIL: I think they want us to pull over.
>> MALORY: Obviously, you idiot! Why?!
>> CHERLENE: Kidnapping! It's a kidnapping, it's a kidnapping to kidnap me, Cherlene!
>> LANA: Why would bikers want to kidnap you?
>> MALORY: Why would anyone?
>> CYRIL: Yeah, you're not even famous.
>> CHERLENE: Yet! Duh! Neither was Frank Sinatra Jr. Now pull over!
>> LANA: We are not...
>> CHERLENE: Hey, treebeard! Take me with you! You can do unspeakable things to and/or on me! I... (shrieks)
>> LANA: You are not getting kidnapped just to boost your singing career!
>> MALORY: Well, now wait a a minute.
>> ARCHER: Wait a minute! Did you tell anybody we were hauling a shitload of coke?!
>> PAM: Uh... (phone rings)  mm... maybe.
>> ARCHER: Maybe?!
>> PAM: Or definitely. Or whatever.
>> ARCHER: Goddamn it, Pam!
>> PAM: I wanted people to like me.
>> ARCHER: People who like you because you have cocaine aren't people you want as friends, Pam. And not to sound elitist, but neither are people who need a roll of quarters to take a shower!
>> PAM: It's not just a shower, it's more communal, like a Japanese onsen, or...
>> ARCHER: Wow! I didn't think it was po ible, but I somehow just got even angrier!
>> PAM: What the heck are you looking for?
>> LANA: Gun! Gun-gun-gun-gun! Cyril look out!
>> CYRIL: No! (all yelling)
>> CYRIL: Oh, God! (bikers scream)
>> PAM: They're shooting at them!
>> ARCHER: And I'd love nothing more than to shoot back, Pam, but somehow, I can't find my gun!
>> PAM: Huh.
>> MALORY: For the love of God, just pull over!
>> CYRIL: Uh, okay.
>> LANA: Cyril, do not stop this bus!
>> CYRIL: Okay!
>> MALORY: Let's just give them Cherlene. That is the very definition of a win-win!
>> CHERLENE: Yes!
>> LANA: No!
>> CHERLENE: Why do you always ruin everything for me?!
>> LANA: Why do you always never shut up?!
>> ARCHER: Because where the hell is my gun?!
>> PAM: Are you, like, sure you brought it? (gunfire, both scream)
>> LANA: Ugh! Move! (Cyril gasps)
>> MALORY: Oh, shut up.
>> LANA: Seriously. (tires squeal, horns blare) (bikers scream)
>> ARCHER: Where's my gun, Pam?! What, did you spit it in some trucker's mouth, too?!
>> PAM: Okay, so, apparently a big thing at truck stops is a game called craps. And apparently I'm not good at it. (Pam screams)
>> CYRIL: Lana, Lana, Lana!
>> LANA: Thank you, Cyril, I have eyeballs! (biker screams) (Lana chuckles)
>> LANA: Yeah, bitch, that's how I roll! Shit! (all scream, tires screech)
>> ARCHER: Because even a goddamn baby knows, in craps, you never bet on the hard ways! Ow! Oh shi...
>> ALL: ...it! (both screaming)
>> PAM: You mad?
>> ARCHER: Give ya three gue es, Pam.
>> PAM: No? No? No?
>> ARCHER: Wrong, Pam. Although I bet I'm not as mad as Mother's gonna be when I tell her this was all your fault!
>> PAM: Aw, come on, Archer, don't do that! That's not what good buddies do!
>> ARCHER: Okay, first of all, you have wildly misjudged our relationship!
>> LANA: Archer!
>> ARCHER: Lana!
>> PAM: Yeah, you're one to talk.
>> ARCHER: And you're lucky I don't have my gun!
>> MALORY: And just why the hell don't you?!
>> ARCHER: Yeah, tell them why that is, Pam!
>> PAM: Oh, come on, please?
>> ARCHER: I...! (groans) I-I didn't think I would need it. (Cherlene gasps)
>> CHERLENE: You didn't think?! Well, it's a good damn thing I ain't paying you to think!
>> ARCHER: Yeah, you're not actually pay... Ow!
>> CHERLENE: The quite-soon- -to-be-number-one country singer in America?! And you don't think I'm a kidnapping risk?!
>> ARCHER: Wait-- you do? Ow!
>> LANA: Yeah, you know, I'm with Archer. I think those bikers just wanted to rob us, or...
>> PAM: What?! I mean, that's just absolutely crazy. We have nothing.
>> MALORY: Well, I would like to revisit this whole kidnapping idea when we have more time, but she still has a show in two hours and we've still got...
>> CYRIL: I think about a hundred miles.
>> LANA: And one extremely flat tire, so... (screams)
>> CHERLENE: Fix it! I will be on my tour bus putting whiskey and glue inside me.
>> MALORY: You heard her. Fix it.
>> PAM: Yeah, you guys chill on the bus. I'll help lickbag here change the tire.
>> MALORY: Oh, my God.
>> PAM: Sorry, I had to sell it. Chop-chop! Get the lead out, lickbag!
>> ARCHER: (sighs) And what's with the "lickbag" stuff? >> PAM (laughing): It's your CB handle! I told it to everybody from here to Kentucky! (clicks tongue) Good buddy. (chomps)
>> ARCHER: (grunting) Whew! Okay, that's got it.
>> MALORY: Well, it took you long enough.
>> ARCHER: Yeah, Mother, nine whole minutes start to finish, what an incompetent boob.
>> MALORY: Your words.
>> ARCHER: You know...
>> CHERLENE: Rrrgh! Can we freaking go already?!
>> PAM: Yeah, whatcha waiting for, lickbag? (belches) (engine accelerating, tires squealing) (freestyle scatting) (clears throat)
>> PAM: Ten-four.
>> LANA: So, I think we may have a problem.
>> ARCHER: Yeah, no shit. I keep waiting for her to have a heart attack, but...
>> LANA: Not Pam.
>> PAM: Yay!
>> LANA: The cops. >> PAM: Boo.
>> ARCHER: Oh, shit! (siren wailing)
>> LANA: Yeah, I'm gonna pull over.
>> MALORY: No! No! Curtain is in ten minutes!
>> LANA: What do you want me to do, run from the cops?
>> MALORY: I want you to take that exit for the venue. Let Sterling deal with this in that ridiculous blocker car.
>> ARCHER: Yeah, good, you guys get out of here; we'll lure them away and outrun them.
>> PAM: In this shit-heap? Are you nuts?!
>> ARCHER: Are you? You want them to get pulled over with 50 pounds of cocaine?
>> ALL: What?!
>> ARCHER: Or kilos, or whatever.
>> MALORY: You put 50 kilos of cocaine on this bus without my permi ion?! Sterling?!
>> LANA: You have to pre the button.
>> MALORY: The what?
>> LANA: Oh, for... You dated Burt Reynolds!
>> PAM: They don't have the coke, lickbag! We do! Right here in the Trans Am!
>> MALORY: Oh. Well, then problem solved. (sirens wailing)
>> ARCHER: So, I have a question.
>> PAM: I switched the coke in Little Rock, 'cause I was worried that...
>> ARCHER: That because of your fat, blabbering mouth Lana would get caught with it and have to have her baby in prison? Or because you were low on cupcakes?! (tires squealing)
>> PAM: Does the why really matter?
>> CHERLENE: * Eastbound and down Loaded up and truckin' * We gonna do what they say can't be done We got a long way to go * And a short time to get...
>> PAM: Yeah! Check it out, lickbag! Cherlene wrote a song about us.
>> ARCHER: What? She didn't write a... That's from Smokey and the... Goddamn it!
>> PAM: Oww! What the shit, Snidely Whiplash?!
>> ARCHER: Now both of our cars are me ed up! I just leveled the playing field!
>> PAM: Oh, my God, I can't feel my face!
>> ARCHER: Gee, Pam, I wonder if that's got anything to do with your cocaine-only diet!
>> PAM: Well, it's a small price to pay for beauty! (gun clicking) (gunshot)
>> ARCHER: Damn it!
>> PAM: Man, and here you are without your gun. That's pretty ironic, huh?
>> ARCHER: No, Pam, once again you're confusing the word ironic with "you are an idiot". What's ironic is that every other store we drive by is a gun shop!
>> PAM: Oh. Okay, so then what's satire?
>> ARCHER: Nobody really knows! Hang on! (tires squealing) And then back up a sec. You're endangering your life for beauty?
>> PAM: Yes, duh. Look, how hot am I now? Let me answer that for you. As balls. That's why everybody likes me now.
>> ARCHER: Who, your trucker buddies?! They only like you because you have coke, Pam.
>> PAM:, Well, and the snowballs, but...
>> ARCHER: And for what it's worth, we all kind of liked you the way you were. (gunshot)
>> PAM: Really?
>> ARCHER: Well, we hated you le . You kind of turned into a ginormous a hole.
>> PAM: Yeah, with ginormous big tittays.
>> ARCHER: Oh, for... Pam, who cares? That's just subcutaneous adipose ti ue. Albeit a shitload of it. But I can't bang you if you die from an overdose.
>> PAM: Aw, you want to bang me? (gunshot)
>> ARCHER: Obviously! I mean look at those big bastards! Sucks we're gonna go to prison, though.
>> PAM: Prison? But it's my first offense.
>> ARCHER: Well, except for treason, but explain all that to the Brazos County judge, and maybe he'll...
>> PAM: Wait a minute, we're in Travis county. Why does their car say Brazos county?
>> ARCHER: Give you three gue es!
>> PAM: Crooked cops?
>> ARCHER: Yes!
>> PAM: Hang on, I still got two...
>> ARCHER: Pam, get the coke!
>> PAM: Yeah! Holy coke snacks. Enable the shit out of me!
>> ARCHER: What? Not to snort, you idiot!
>> PAM: Well, I don't want to shoot it. That seems like a pretty slippery slope!
>> ARCHER: Pam, any cocaine is a slippery slope! It's the world's most addictive drug.
>> PAM: Hang on, I heard it was nicotine.
>> ARCHER: It may very well be, Pam, but in our current situation I would argue that cocaine is more dangerous, because we're about to get murdered for it! (gunshots) (tires squealing)
>> PAM: Yeah, but not overall, is what I'm...
>> ARCHER: Pam, they don't want us, they just want the coke, so throw it out!
>> PAM: Of the car?
>> ARCHER: Pam!
>> PAM: Jeez, okay! But you're gonna owe me!
>> ARCHER: What could I po ibly owe you?!
>> PAM: I believe there was some mention of bone-throwing?
>> ARCHER: Okay, yeah, that seems like a win-win.
>> CHARLENE: * I'm eastbound Just watch ol' Bandit run! * (screaming) (sirens stop)
>> CHERLENE: Woo-hooo! Thank you! Good night, Travis County! There will be no encore! Woooooo! (crowd booing)
>> MALORY: Wait, what?
>> CHERLENE: Outlaw country!
>> MALORY: No, no, no, you don't walk off after one song; you get back out there this instant. What are you doing?
>> CHERLENE: Uh, it's called cultivating mystique?
>> MALORY: But...
>> CHERLENE: It's also called sniffing a shit-ton of glue in my tour bus hot tub because I personify outlaw country?
>> MALORY: The...
>> CHERLENE: Outlaw country! Woooooo!
>> TONY: Howdy, Tony Foti, Stringer Records, and I want to make that little gal famous. Are you her manager, Mrs...?
>> MALORY: Oh, no, it's actually Ms....
>> LANA: It's actually Mrs.
>> MALORY: Will you put...
>> TONY: It genuinely does not matter. Give me a call when y'all are ready to make some gold records. Yee-haw! (slaps)
>> MALORY: Ooh! Well, that went better than expected.
>> LANA: Yeah, maybe you can use the gold records to pay Archer and Pam's bail.
>> CYRIL: I actually don't think you can.
>> ARCHER: Plus there's no need.
>> LANA: Wait, what?
>> MALORY: Sterling!
>> ARCHER: Yeah, no, everything is, uh, totally fine now, and we totally got away. So, all set.
>> MALORY: Yes, but how? The police were right behind you.
>> ARCHER: Which is right where I wanted them, so I could go old school Bandit. With an inverted triple Needham.
>> MALORY: Well, it was your own fault for bringing cocaine without asking, but I suppose all's well that ends well.
>> PAM: Well, except for...
>> ARCHER: Pam? All's well that ends well?
>> PAM: Oh, right. But what about the hundred pounds of coke you dumped on the highway?
>> MALORY: What?
>> ARCHER: Pam!
