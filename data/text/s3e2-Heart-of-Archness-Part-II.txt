PAM: Aw c'maaaahn! Clock yer skinny a  out already, and let's go get outside some dranks!
CHERYL/CAROL: Ugh, I can't! I have to cover her stupid phone in case those stupid pirates call with a stupid ransom demand for Mr. Stupid Archer!
MALORY: Carol? ! Carol! Have they called? !
CHERYL/CAROL: No! Ma'am! But rest a ured I'll let you know the minute they dooo!
MALORY: Rest? My God, who can rest...
CHERYL/CAROL: Not me, apparently.
CYRIL: Or me! I have to re-do the annual budget because she's blowing it all on this so-called rescue of Archer!
PAM: Well his plane did crash, and the distre  signal was last heard coming from a known pirate fortre , so...
CYRIL: So? ! That doesn't mean Ray and Lana have to bankrupt ISIS getting there!
GILLETTE: Oh, would you relax? You rent a boat, that money's gone. This way, we can sell it when we're done. I bet it'll come out cheaper.
LANA: I wasn't talking about the boat.
GILLETTE: I think five grand for the week was a steal. Look at him, he is lithe.
LANA: So a twink escort your rent, but --
GILLETTE: That's different! I mean, they did ask if I wanted to actually buy him, but I thought...
LANA: What, that I'd be weird about it?
GILLETTE: I --
LANA: That I, perhaps due to my race, might have a problem with the concept of owning a human being?
GILLETTE: I actually just thought I'd get tired of him.
LANA: You? Mr. Can't Even Commit To A Pet?
GILLETTE: Wh-? Yeah hi, two cats! One of whom I think has FIP, so... commit that.
CYRIL: You know how hard I worked on this budget? ! Nights, weekends, canceled my vacation, and now it's all wasted!
PAM: Wasted, exactly, let's go be that! C'mon, happy hour at Pita Margarita's!
CHERYL/CAROL: Is... that what it sounds like?
PAM: Only if it sounds like a shitload of tequila and some A-rab hoagies.
MALORY: How dare you? !
PAM: Arab, sorry.
MALORY: Oh shut up, how can you even think about happy hour at a time like this? ! When probably as we speak, my poor Sterling is being tortured by pirates!
CYRIL: I wish...
MALORY: What? !
CYRIL: Wish you wouldn't say that! Because I'm sure he's not being tortured...
ARCHER: Aaaaaaaaaaaagghhhhhhh! Ohhhh my God, stop, stop, stop, seriously I can't take anymore! Whew! That was insane, I never even heard of that position! Did the mi ionaries not swing by here, or...?
NOAH: Excuse me? Sorry, pirate-king Archer?
ARCHER: What! Noah!
NOAH: Ready for the uh, morning briefing?
ARCHER: Noah, I'm half drunk and slathered in... every bodily fluid there is. So yeah, this is about as piratekingy as I'm gonna get. Brief away!
NOAH: Okay, item one! The --
ARCHER: Noah.
NOAH: Yes sir?
ARCHER: Good morning. NOAH: O.K. Item one. The huge morale problem.
ARCHER: How do we have a morale problem?
NOAH: Well first of all --
ARCHER: C'mon, karaoke night's a big hit...
PIRATE: Roti dan mentega, bakar dan selai!
ARCHER: Woooo! We have an awesome feast every night... Woooo! Not to mention intramural lacro e! Woooo! Woooo! Woooo! So how can they have low morale?
NOAH: Well um, besides all of those things, they haven't been paid.
ARCHER: So pay 'em, what do you need, new payroll software? Cyril always handled all that stuff. Payroll, budgets, he's a genius at that crap...
CYRIL: Just find the money, Cyril! You're an accounting genius, Cyril! That's right you bitch. I said it. So good luck finding all these Swi  accounts! Mwah ha! Mwah ha ha ha ha haaaaaa!
PAM: Whatcha doin?
CYRIL: Aagh! Hey, Pam...
NOAH: No, we don't need --
ARCHER: Oh! And dealing with disgruntled employees, Pam's great at that...
PAM: Izzat innernet porn?
CYRIL: Uh, yep! Just, um... just jackin it.
PAM: Can I watch? Or izzat weird?
CYRIL: It's... kinda weird.
PAM: Is it?
CYRIL: Yes.
ARCHER: I think it's because she's such a good listener.
NOAH: And she sounds lovely. But you don't need an HR rep and payroll software --
ARCHER: Couldn't hurt...
NOAH: Sir! Please! Pirates work for shares, and since you became pirateking there hasn't been any booty, so --
ARCHER: Gonna have to go ahead and disagree with you there, buddy.
NOAH: From pirated ships.
ARCHER: Oh. I thought you meant from the --
NOAH: Native girls, no.
ARCHER: Sorry, I don't know all the pirate terms yet.
NOAH: Well --
ARCHER: I'm new! To all of this! Especially the actual, you know, piracy part... It's not really what I expected. Dammit, I said get over there! For the jillionth time, nobody is raping anybody! Actually no, you know what? ! Now nobody gets anything, because I'm letting him go! [ Grumbling ] Shut up! He's a small busine  owner! If he loses his ship he'll be ruined! You can go. Ooh, but can we get about fifty pounds of tuna steaks?
NOAH: Which you let him talk you down to twenty.
ARCHER: Well? ! You know what kinda margins those guys work on?
NOAH: I actually don't...
ARCHER: Well nice Ph.D.!
NOAH: My field's anthropology. And I'm actually just a doctoral candidate? Or I was, until these guys captured my research ve el and enslaved me...
ARCHER: Ugh, not this again...
NOAH: So I was thinking, if you freed me...
ARCHER: You're my translator, I need you. That's why I made you first mate.
NOAH: Which also went over pretty badly.
ARCHER: Yeah, people hate you so let's just put a pin in the whole... manumi ion thing.
NOAH: But --
ARCHER: Noah! Morale's low enough as it is. And I bet I know who's to blame!
NOAH: No kidding...
RILEY: I'm not kidding, this Archer guy's gonna get you all killed. He --
ARCHER: Riley! RILEY: Archer, what a coincidence. I was just talking about you.
ARCHER: With who? Cause that bucktooth little shit doesn't even speak English!
BUCKY: I do little bit --
ARCHER: No you don't.
BUCKY: -- and correct syntax is "with whom!" NOAH: Man, that is not gonna help morale.
RILEY: Yeah, Bucky's an incorrigible go ip.
ARCHER: Who -- to whom you are forbidden to speak! I locked you down here so you couldn't contact my mother, not so you could, whatever, sow disharmony!
RILEY: You're sowing plenty all by yourself. Face it kid, you're a bust as a pirateking.
ARCHER: King, exactly! And unle  you want to spend the rest of the afternoon with a bunch of scorpions, don't forget it!
MALORY: And remember, this is a rescue mi ion.
LANA: I heard you.
MALORY: So don't charge in there all crazy, machine-gunning everything in sight.
LANA: When have I --
MALORY: I'm sure you'd love it if Sterling were killed in some huge cro  fire --
LANA: Wh-? No I wouldn't!
MALORY: -- but just try to control all your jealousy and, ick, sexual frustration. LANA: Oh no, you're breaking up.
MALORY: Lana.
LANA: I mean, am I jealous because Archer gets preferential treatment? Yes. But am I still attracted to him?
GILLETTE: Is a pig's a  pork? I'm sorry, did you wanna hear what I think, or just what you wanna hear? He asked, pretty sarcastically.
BUCKY: Raja lemah! Raja lemah!
BUCKY: Kita memerlukan raja baru!
ARCHER: Whoa whoa! Bucky! What is this? !
BUCKY: We hold erections for king!
ARCHER: Well, flattering, not really nece ary...
NOAH: He means elections.
ARCHER: Okay, that makes more -- wait, what? !
BUCKY: Time for new king! Raja baru!
PIRATES: [ grumblings ]
ARCHER: Okay, pirates! Hey! Take a knee! Noah You wanna...?
NOAH: That won't translate. It's like last week when you said "lend me your ears" and they were like "Apa?"
ARCHER: Damn it --
NOAH: I can't do idioms.
ARCHER: Shut up. Then unshut up, and tell them I understand their frustration...
NOAH: Do you? Saya mendengar anda!
ARCHER: But you don't change horses in mid --
NOAH: Idiom!
ARCHER: Now is not the time for a new king! NOAH: Sekarang tidak ada raja baru!
ARCHER: Because the king is strong!
NOAH: Raja yang kuat!
BUCKY: If you so strong... melawan raja!
PIRATES: Yah! Melawan raja! Melawan raja!
ARCHER: What's melawan raja?
NOAH: King-fight. If the king loses to a challenger in one-on-one combat, he has to step down. Or just be dead.
ARCHER: Since when? !
NOAH: Since 19... always. Did you not read the orientation materials?
ARCHER: Woooo! Mmmmore skimmed it?
BUCKY: Enough talk! Melawan raja!
ARCHER: Okay Bucky, we'll melawan raja...
NOAH: Oh, one thing --
ARCHER: Noah shut up and translate. I accept your challenge!
NOAH: Cabaran diterima!
ARCHER: Because your mouth's been writing checks your butt
can't cash, NOAH: Anda -- Do you even know what an idiom is?
ARCHER: Colloquial metaphor.
NOAH: No, it's -- well actually yes, but I really think this is a bad idea --
ARCHER: I'm not remunerating you to think, Noah! Even if you weren't a slave. And your three-fifths of an opinion is noted, so -- oh sweet Jesus Jones!
NOAH: See, Bucky doesn't have to fight you himself. He can choose a stand-in.
ARCHER: Who is... huge!
NOAH: That's what I was --
ARCHER: Why didn't he come out for lacro e? ! BUCKY: You lucky I don't let him!
ARCHER: Let him?
NOAH: He's Bucky's girlfriend.
ARCHER: Way to eschew traditional gender roles, pirates. NOAH: Yeah, they're fascinating...
BUCKY: Now we melawan raja! And then we see who is bucktooth little shit!
ARCHER: It'll still be you. Listen --
BUCKY: Melawaaaaaaan rajaaaaa!
PIRATES: Mela-wan, ra-ja! Mela-wan, ra-ja!
ARCHER: Hey, maybe there's a way to make some money on this. Bet on me.
NOAH: I would, but who'd bet on -- wait, don't you have that backwards?
LANA: No. Because you know what I bet?
GILLETTE: I bet I know you're gonna tell me...
LANA: I bet after we Zodiac in past the reef, take out at least one O.P., make our way through a jungle full of Claymores, neutralize the fortre garrison, and finally extract that kidnapped-gettin a  sonuvabitch, he's gonna be all like --
ARCHER: Woooooo!
LANA: Wuhhhhh! Like this whole thing was all just part of some... dumbshit master plan.
GILLETTE: She said, trying to convince herself that she no longer ached for his -- Oww!
LANA: I'm sorry, what were you gonna say?
GILLETTE: Cock.
ARCHER: Suck it! Cause I'm still the king!
BUCKY: This no fair! You break the rules!
ARCHER: What rules? ! We're pirates!
BUCKY: Melawan raja mean hand-hand combat!
ARCHER: Boo-hoo, show me! Show me where it says that! Take your time. I'm hourly.
BUCKY: I know it in here somewhere... Damn! Okay, maybe it don't say this exact words, but everybody know --
ARCHER: Nooop! Fair is -- well it wasn't exactly fair, but since it wasn't expre ly forbidden... tough titties! Wow, I never realized how much we rely idioms.
BUCKY: You win this round, Archer!
ARCHER: Duh.
BUCKY: But every dog has its day! ARCHER: See? Idiom.
BUCKY: And when that day come Bucky make you sorry! Bucky make you say --
RILEY: Mayday mayday mayday... This is Rip Riley calling ISIS, over.
ARCHER: Noah.
NOAH: That's not me.
ARCHER: I know that! RILEY: Damn it, is that the P.A.?! Way to eschew traditional labeling, pirates.
ARCHER: Fascinating. Because since when is there a radio in the damn dungeon? !
NOAH: God, you really shoulda read your orientation materials.
ARCHER: Noah!
NOAH: Radio room!
RILEY: Mayday mayday mayday, this is Rip Riley calling ISIS. Mayday may --
MALORY: Rip? !
RILEY: Finally. Malory, listen to me very --
MALORY: How's Sterling, is he hurt or -- oh God, have the pirates tortured him? ! RILEY: Uh, no.
MALORY: Oh thank God, I was -- wait, are you under dure ? ! If you are, key your handset twice!
RILEY: I'm not under dure , I'm --
MALORY: Well, that's exactly what you'd say if you were under dure , so --
RILEY: Malory! I don't have a lot of time, so please listen very carefully...
MALORY: I'm listening!
RILEY: Your son, is --
ARCHER: Nooo! [ BLAM! ]
MALORY: Oh my -- Carol! Somebody? !
CHERYL/CAROL: What.
MALORY: Sterling... I think... he's been shot!
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh my God. So then can I go home?
ARCHER: I told you, I'm not going anywhere! Especially not back to ISIS, and especially not now that I just shot -- What I a ume was the only radio?
NOAH: Yeah, "See about getting a backup radio" was itemmmmm five.
ARCHER: And item one, is Riley get your a  back in your cell!
NOAH: Item one's actually the morale problem.
ARCHER: Noah? RILEY: More like potential mutiny.
NOAH: Yeah, right? Gonna go ahead and change "morale problem" to "potential mutiny"...
ARCHER: No! You're not! Because there is no mutiny, potential or otherwi --
BUCKY: Pemberontakan!
PIRATES: Pemberontakan!
ARCHER: So, is that Malay for --
NOAH: Mutiny, yes. So I gue  I should upgrade it from "potential" to --
RILEY: Incipient?
NOAH: Ooh, nice...
ARCHER: No! Do not upgrade that mutiny, Noah! I will tell you! When it's time! To upgrade the damn -- Mutiny, okay, so... What comes after incipient?
RILEY: In progre ?
NOAH: Nailed it! [ Muffled Dialogue ]
ARCHER: This is what I was talking about, with the whole tinnitis thing!
You hear that high-pitched whine? It's like NOAH: Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
ARCHER: Noah!
NOAH: Aagh! What? !
ARCHER: I -- well for one thing, I'm kinda regretting making you first mate! NOAH: Me too! Now I'm... management!
RILEY: Archer!
ARCHER: What? !
RILEY: Shut up! Noah! NOAH: What? !
RILEY: What'd you say about a backup radio? !
NOAH: That we need one! It's itemmmm... Five!
RILEY: Oh well that's just --
ARCHER: A battering ram?
BUCKY: Archer! Kami membunuhmu! ARCHER: What was that, what'd he say?
NOAH: "We're going to kill you."
ARCHER: Oh. Thought they were surrendering.
RILEY: Why? ! Would you think that? !
ARCHER: They did before! For no good reason!
RILEY: At least then we had a ault weapons! Now we've only got -- give me that!
ARCHER: Yeah go nuts, Sundance, it's empty.
RILEY: It's empty! Because you emptied it! Into the only radio on the island!
ARCHER: All six, right in the ten ring...
RILEY: Well, congratulations! We're trapped!
ARCHER: We're not -- Trapped. Okay yeah, we're trapped.
NOAH: Uh, heah gang... why don't we just use that?
ARCHER: Well obviously we're gonna use that.
PIRATES: Hantu!
BUCKY: They not ghosts! They just white!
PIRATE: Rasis.
BUCKY: You're racist!
MALORY: Those dirty pirate bastards! They killed my baby boy-hoy-hooyyy!
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh now, you don't know that for sure...
MALORY: You're right! That sound could've been anything! Like... a firecracker! Orientals are crazy for firecrackers!
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh my God, and rice?
MALORY: Or maybe Rip shot a pirate, and Sterling yelled "No" because he didn't want to give away their position!
CHERYL/CAROL: And opium.
MALORY: Yes, you know, I bet they've escaped!
CHERYL/CAROL: oh my God... and rice.
MALORY: Because if anyone can escape from a pirate fortre , it's Sterling and Rip. Especially if they cooperate.
RILEY: Damn it, quit stepping on my hands, you idiot!
ARCHER: Quit bo ing me around! You're not my -- wait, tell me there's no chance you're my father.
RILEY: Not unle  you're -- Fifteen.
ARCHER: Thank God.
RILEY: The feeling's mutual. Because if my son was as big a bonehead as you --
ARCHER: You have a son?
RILEY: Wh-? No.
ARCHER: Then shut up. Noah! Where the hell does this go? !
NOAH: I don't know, down!
ARCHER: Wow, you're only a doctoral candidate...
NOAH: Hey guy, my field's anthropology!
RILEY: Good luck with the job hunt.
ARCHER: Right?
NOAH: Not that it's any of your busine , but I plan to teach? !
ARCHER: Anthropology. NOAH: Wh-? Yes!
RILEY: To anthropology majors.
NOAH: Hey ya know what?
ARCHER: Thus continuing the circle of why bother. NOAH: Anthropology is an important field of study!
ARCHER: I'm pretty sure somebody's already named all the different spiders!
NOAH: Wh-? That's arachnology!
ARCHER: I know! Equally huge waste of time!
NOAH: Hey speaking of, can we go back up?
ARCHER: Oh my God. Not really. Why?
NOAH: Just curious.
ARCHER: Go go go go go!
RILEY: Waaaagh!
ARCHER: Waaaagh! Oh, shi -- That was just a flash-bang grenade! Still super-bad for your ears, So when we get outta here, you should go see my ENT doctor, he's good.
RILEY: How the hell are we supposed to get out of here? !
ARCHER: Isn't this your cell?
RILEY: Yes! ARCHER: So how'd you get out before?
RILEY: I bribed Bucky!
ARCHER: Noah!
NOAH: What?
ARCHER: That is annoying as shit! And I doubt we can bribe Bucky again, since I crippled his girlfriend...
RILEY: So what're we supposed to do now? !
ARCHER: I dunno.
MALORY: But I may as well go home and rest. If they haven't escaped already, Lana will be there anytime now, and she'll get them out. And it's not like I can do anything from here...
CHERYL/CAROL: Exactly! So why do I have to stay? !
MALORY: Because Lana may call. Or because I said so. Pick one.
CYRIL: Who's jackin' it?
MALORY: And why the hell are you still here?
CYRIL: I, um, this is, uh, what was I doing? MALORY: Whatever it was, you better pray it had about three coats of Scotch-Gard.
CYRIL: And that it wasn't, ick, Pam...
LANA: His narrow twinky a  better not steal the boat, is all I'm saying... Oh! And just, before we get in there, I am not still attracted to Archer! I'm sure he's still attracted to me, I mean, he'd have to be Uh, blind... not to, um... I am so sorry about that. Does it hurt? Ray, seriously, I'm sorry. Oh, now you're giving me the silent treatment? ! What're you, six? !
GILLETTE: No... Just profe ional. Hey, pirates...
ARCHER: Okay, then how 'bout this? We set Noah on fire --
NOAH: What?
ARCHER: -- and when they come to put him out, we overpower them.
RILEY: Don't have a lighter.
ARCHER: Well then I'm out of ideas. BUCKY: And also out of luck! Because no rescue for you, Archer! We catch your friends on beach!
ARCHER: But -- Ray? ! Holy shit, where'd you -- -- get that eye patch? ! What're you, in pirate disguise? ! Great job, buddy! Looks great! Lana? ! You, you came all this way? ! To rescue me? Oh my God...
LANA: Archer don't you... Still got it pretty bad for me, huh?
LANA: Archer, don't you dare --
ARCHER: Woooooo!
