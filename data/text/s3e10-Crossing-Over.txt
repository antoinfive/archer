ARCHER: Ugh, no, forget the gla , Woodhouse, just gimme the pitcher... For I am a sinner in the hands of an angry God. Bloody Mary, full of vodka, ble ed are you among cocktails... Pray for me, now and at the hour of my death, which I hope is soon, amen.
WOODHOUSE: Er, perhaps a coddled egg--
ARCHER: No. No eggs, Woodhouse. Maybe ever again.
WOODHOUSE: Some dry toast?
ARCHER: Yeah, or you could skip a step and just feed me some vomit.
WOODHOUSE: Not like you to get a hangover, sir. ARCHER: Yeah, I don't know what happened. I kinda remember being at the wake...
MALORY: Oh, you poor dear. On behalf of his fellow ISIS agents, please let me be the first to offer my condolences.
ARCHER: And let me be the first to welcome you back into the dating pool. (burp) And-or-also my new, hic, hot tub. But after that it's just... snippets. I think I had one more drink there...
EVERYBODY: Drink, drink, drink, drink!
ARCHER: And then I think I took a cab... Hang on, wait, lemme see some hands! Who wants chicken and waffles? ! How did we bring food in here? ! Oh, and also, did we lose some people? !
PAM: Lana'n Cyril bailed! Triflin bitches! Here! Le  yer a triflin bitch too!
ARCHER: Agh! What'd I just put inside me? !
PAM: Green Ru ians! It's absinthe and -- Milk, sweet shitsnacks lookit those!
ARCHER: Oh! My! God! That's right! It's somewhat coming back to me!
PAM: Woooo! I'm Pacman Jones!
ARCHER: Come home with me! Plus my valet will give you some heroin!
WOODHOUSE: Thankfully I didn't have to share.
ARCHER: But she did, she came home with me! I remember! I mean, Green Ru ians, it's fuzzy, I don't remember this... But I do remember her being the best sex I've ever had in my life!
WOODHOUSE: Er --
ARCHER: Shut up, and that includes Europe, Lana, my Brazilian au pair...! No woman has ever made me -- oh shit!
WOODHOUSE: Sir...?
ARCHER: Phone number? ! Matchbook? ! I don't know her name, where she works... Woodhouse, how am I gonna find her? !
WOODHOUSE: Ahem. You might check the loo.
ARCHER: What, here? ! Why didn't you say so? !
WOODHOUSE: Oww!
ARCHER: Oww! Ow, ow, ow... Uh, so hey, hi. I'm Sterling Archer, you may remember me from the strip club, and hopefully also from what was hands down the most incredible sex that I personally have ever had. Hello? Oh right, so I know we had an implied oral agreement about heroin...
PAM: Heroin? !
ARCHER: Wh-? !
PAM: That's the last frickin thing I need. I'm bound up tighter'n dick's hatband.
ARCHER: No, not... were you...? Did we...?
PAM: Yeah, we did. And you loved it!
ARCHER: [incoherent gibberish] KATHUMP! [FART]
PAM: Okay, jeez, I get it!
ARCHER: Well, you say that, but I worry that you think I'm exaggerating when I say --
PAM: That I was the best sex you ever had?
ARCHER: No... That if anybody ever finds out about it, I will literally - Pam, look at me - I will literally murder you.
PAM: Not literally...
ARCHER: Yes literally! You will wake up in three separate fifty-gallon drums!
PAM: That's a hundred and fifty gallons. Of Pam's hot, dirty, ball-slappiney --
ARCHER: Gaaghh!
PAM: Come at me bro! How ya gonna keep 'em, down on the farm, after they seen Pam-ee?
ARCHER: Yeah, how're you gonna... I mean, my God, you can't, that, that was just --
MALORY: Disgusting! And I hoped I would never have to say this, but you finally topped your tenth grade sports banquet!
ARCHER: I -- okay first of all, Mrs. Coach Mumford came on to me. And second of all... what're we talking about?
MALORY: Hitting on your dead colleague's widow? ! At his own wake? !
ARCHER: Oh, that. Okay, so --
MALORY: So help me God, Sterling, sometimes I think that I've failed as a mother.
ARCHER: Sometimes?
MALORY: Oh shut up, and the last thing you need is another drink. LANA: Ugh, seriously, how can you be drinking after last night?
ARCHER: How can you not?
LANA: Because I don't have a problem.
MALORY: Well, I do...
ARCHER: First step's admitting it, Mother.
MALORY: Wh-? Not with drinking!
ARCHER: Eh... LANA: Eh...
MALORY: My problem, besides your snide remarks is Nikolai Jakov, head of the KGB.
LANA: And also po ibly Archer's father.
ARCHER: Wh-?
MALORY: How do you know about that? !
LANA: Because I'm part of Everybody?
MALORY: Damn that blabbermouthing Pam... ARCHER: Why, what'd she say? ! Besides the stuff about Jakov, which obviously is what you meant, so...
MALORY: So, Nikolai has been dropping hints that he may want to defect.
ARCHER: What? !
LANA: That's awesome!
MALORY: I think you mean awful. LANA: Uh, ISIS getting an inside look at every single KGB operation in the world? And that's awful how?
MALORY: Because he thinks he's going to move in with me! Me, who happens to be in a relationship with Burt Reynolds, in case you've forgotten?
ARCHER: I actually did forget that.
LANA: Yeah, I never see you together. I mean, are you like dating, or...?
MALORY: It's... complicated. What with our work schedules, and... work, it's hard to find time for actual dates.
LANA: But you do see one another...
MALORY: Well yes of course, but --
ARCHER: But never in public, right? Only at your place, or maybe a hotel, or --
PAM: Or on the dirty floor in the elevator?
MALORY: Wh-? Pam! Get your bloated carca  --
ARCHER: Out, I got it, I'm on this I got it!
MALORY: How did she know about the elevator?
LANA: I -- ew.
MALORY: Burt made sure I erased the security tape. Wait, could -- you don't think Burt's ashamed to be seen with me? Lana.
LANA: I'm sorry?
ARCHER: Well I'm sorry, but if anybody ever found out I'd die of shame!
PAM: Well how do ya think that makes me feel? !
ARCHER: I don't care Pam! Now, having said that, would you please come in this dirty toilet stall and have sex with me.
PAM: Ugh, oh alright! But this time get in there. All ya been doin' is givin' one side hell.
BARRY: Well, when you put it like that it sounds kinda shitty.
JAKOV: Thirty years of my life I giff to the KGB? ! End now you, this, this traitorous cyborg? ! Are seeting et my desk? ! How would you put it? !
BARRY: Yeah, you really got cornholed, huh? Wait, don't answer yet, because I'm also rea igning you to Siberia.
JAKOV: Wh-? ! Siberia? !
BARRY: Barry can't have you moping around here, you know... sowing the discontent!
BORIS: Is bad for morale.
JAKOV: Et tu, Brute? !
BORIS: Et me, buddy. JAKOV: Rrrrrgh!
BARRY: So here's my advice to you: dre  in layers. And don't even think about doing anything crazy like defecting...
JAKOV: I would never defect! I love Mother Ru ia!
BARRY: Even when you're chopping through the ice in the toilet so you can poop? I'm kidding, obviously. You'll be like, six hundred miles from a toilet.
ARCHER: Sorry, had to go to the bathroom, nothing unusual, just uh, you know, normal, um, bodily waste excretion.
MALORY: If you're quite finished --
ARCHER: Damn near.
MALORY: -- then go home, sober up, and make sure your apartment is secure.
ARCHER: Uh, why? To all three of those?
MALORY: Because if and when Nikolai shows up here, he's not staying at my place...
ARCHER: Well, he's not staying with me!
MALORY: Then go prep the safehouse. Because you can bet every KGB agent and freelance a a in this side of Berlin will be hunting him down like a dog.
ARCHER: Who hunts dogs?
CHERYL/CAROL: Orientals, duh!
BARRY: so when you say you a ume Jakov got on that train to Siberia, you know what you're doing?
BORIS: I mek you e .
BARRY: And Barry doesn't like! Being made an a , he really doesn't. And as you can -- well it's over there now, but the telex from the Siberia desk says Jakov never showed up! Now why do you think that might be? !
BORIS: Ummm...
JAKOV: Thenk you, Boris! I wun't forget this!
BORIS: I promised myself I don't cry. Promise broke.
BARRY: What was that?
BORIS: Ellergies?
BARRY: To what, making sure people get on trains? ! Nice one other Barry. Now Jakov's got a twelve-hour head start, and the details of every single KGB operation on the globe in his fat, combed-over head!
BORIS: Da, end we hef no idea where he went!
BARRY: Well I a ume he's in New York, with those shitbitchinga bastard Archers!
BORIS: But -- BARRY: I can a ume! You're already an a ! So contact our sleeper in New York and then cancel all my meetings this week, because I will also be in New York. Murdering people.
JAKOV: Eh, dunt tek this the wrung way? But I pictured you having nicer apartment. [Laughter] Why thet is funny?
MALORY: Hm? Oh no, sorry, there's a funny Marmaduke on the fridge.
JAKOV: A what?
MALORY: And this is actually, ahem, the ISIS safehouse, cheers! JAKOV: Safehouse? But Melory, I a umed --
MALORY: Which you shouldn't have! What, you thought you'd just show up out of the blue and we'd move in together?
JAKOV: Pretty much, yeah.
MALORY: Nikolai, it's not that I don't - am not very fond of you, I mean, we have such history together, and --
JAKOV: End mebbe a son?
MALORY: Mmmmaybe, but --
JAKOV: But so? Where is he?
LANA: Good question. He was supposed to prep this dump --
GILLETTE: And didn't.
LANA: -- and now he's supposed to be here for the first shift of guard duty.
CYRIL: And isn't. JAKOV: Uh --
LANA: Hi, Lana Kane, you must be Major Jakov, such a pleasure, be a lamb and take those to the kitchen? So. I think I speak for all of us when I say we shouldn't be the only ones guarding your maybe-baby-daddy.
MALORY: I can't believe you all know about that...
JAKOV: Wow, thet is big dog!
MALORY: Marmaduke. And regardle  of any... personal ties I may have with Nikolai, he's a invaluable a et and we have to protect him! I mean, you know... at least until he's been debriefed.
LANA: And then? What, he's on his own?
MALORY: Um...
LANA: Wow.
ARCHER: I'm serious, you are literally draining the life out of me. PAM: C'mon, you make me sound like some kinda... chupacabra, but for dicks.
ARCHER: A terrifying yet accurate comparison. Where did you learn all that stuff?
PAM: You know I grew up on a farm, right?
ARCHER: Really hoping that's not relevant.
WOODHOUSE: Ms. Kane... and your mother.
ARCHER: Hooray...
PAM: I gotta bounce. Later taters.
ARCHER: Lana listen, if this is a booty call, I'm flattered, but --
LANA: Oh my God.
MALORY: You're supposed to be guarding Nikolai!
ARCHER: Yeah, so about that, I mean, don't you think that's gonna be... kinda...
JAKOV: [sniffling, weeping]
ARCHER: Awkward?
CYRIL: I actually think it's kinda sweet. ARCHER: Little help?
LANA: No, you're good. The camera's set up for the debriefing, and one of us will relieve you in like, eight hours?
ARCHER: Wait, where are you guys going? !
GILLETTE: Uh, a town called work?
LANA: Neutralizing a KGB sleeper in Brooklyn, thanks to this intel from the major.
JAKOV: It was least I could do.
LANA: Since otherwise he'd kill you?
JAKOV: Is win-win. LANA: Is it?
JAKOV: So!
ARCHER: Yeah.
JAKOV: Sterlink! ARCHER: Yeah.
JAKOV: Is long time.
ARCHER: Yeah, when was... oh! I gue  when I was in the dreaded Lubyanka with jumper cables clamped to my balls!
JAKOV: So da , this is... a little awkward.
ARCHER: Yeah.
JAKOV: Maybe some shots?
ARCHER: Yeah let's try that! LANA: Anytime now... Cyril. Cyril!
CYRIL: Lana, I -- I don't think I'm cut out for this.
LANA: Well, don't take this the wrong way, but neither does anyone else. Just pretend he's, like, a rabid dog.
CYRIL: Oh God, just like Old Yeller!
GILLETTE: Yeah, if Old Yeller had a big stack of KGB codebooks and fif - forty thousand bucks in a floor safe.
LANA: And was also identified as a sleeper agent by the head of the KGB!
KGB AGENT: Who, Barry? !
LANA: What?
KGB AGENT: White? You guys like smooth R&B?
GILLETTE: Duh.
LANA: Are you telling me Barry "The Bionic Douchebag" Dylan is running the KGB?
KGB AGENT: Only if I can defect, too. Because that dude is out of his damn mind.
LANA: I'm listening.
KGB AGENT: He's crazy! I mean he's smart, way smarter than Jakov, but -- oh, and you can bet Jakov's intel is bad!
LANA: Really? This isn't your kneecap?
KGB AGENT: Don't you get it? Barry gave me up so you'd trust Jakov on the rest! He knew Jakov wanted to defect, so --
LANA: So he's been feeding him fake intel?
KGB AGENT: I mean I a ume! Because Barry's got a master plan, which, when you hear it, will probably make your head explo --
LANA: Jesus! GILLETTE: Jesus!
LANA: Ahem. Cyril?
CYRIL: I'm sorry! LANA: Yes. Yes you are.
JAKOV: Is I who em sorry! I should hef been there for you!
ARCHER: Shut up, don't do that, I mean what were you gonna do, marry my mother? Have you met her? Oww!
JAKOV: Dun't you ever disrespect her!
ARCHER: You're not my dad! [Laughter]
JAKOV: How would you know? !
ARCHER: I know, right? !
JAKOV: But I hef to say, you dun't look like me! ARCHER: And don't take this the wrong way, but thank Christ! Oww!
CHERYL/CAROL: Watch it! You dumb idiot!
BARRY: Oh man, I am so sorry! Here, lemme get you some -- oh my God, Cheryl?
CHERYL/CAROL: Barry? !
BARRY: Wow, I was hoping I'd bump into you!
CHERYL/CAROL: Wait, really? BARRY: And darn if I didn't! Literally!
CHERYL/CAROL: You -- wait a minute, why am I thinking you live in like, Ru ia?
BARRY: Mmmmaybe the tracksuit?
CHERYL/CAROL: Duh, right, and which, by the way, you are totally rockiiiing.
BARRY: Oh, that's just... my huge muscles.
CHERYL/CAROL: So tell me... how strong are you?
BARRY: Insanely, wanna get outta here?
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh my God, totally, but like it has to be your place, because mine reeks of ocelot pi .
BARRY: I have no response to that --
CHERYL/CAROL: Doesn't merit one.
BARRY: -- and my place is currently flooding so --
CHERYL/CAROL: Hotel? BARRY: Damn, no money. Tracksuit, no pockets.
CHERYL/CAROL: Damn it!
BARRY: I know, it's the one single drawback. Wait, doesn't ISIS have a safehouse?
CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah, but -- You have promise that all that horrific stuff I think I remember about you is just false memories?
BARRY: I --
CHERYL/CAROL: Because I get those a lot.
BARRY: Cro  the microchip in my heart.
CHERYL/CAROL: Don't get all girly on me. Check!
MALORY: Hold the door! Hold the door!
PAM: Headin out?
MALORY: No, I thought I'd just take all my things for a ride on the elevator.
PAM: Okay.
MALORY: I actually have a date. With Burt Reynolds. We're watching Gator.
PAM: Your place?
MALORY: Well if we go out, you know, he's just mobbed, so...
PAM: So it's a DVD, a box of wine and some Hot Pockets, and off to bed.
MALORY: No! Well, it's not a box of wine. Pam, let me ask you something...
JAKOV: How ken you just leave me here? !
ARCHER: Mainly because I have an incredibly addictive personality. So just debrief yourself with the camera, and when I get back we'll talk about the DNA test thing, if, ya know, you're still into doing that.
JAKOV: Of course I em still into thet! But in meantime, you think I will be safe?
ARCHER: God, what's Ru ian for duh? It's a safehouse! Nobody knows where it is!
CHERYL/CAROL: Well, here it is!
BARRY: Neat. Can I see your neck a minute?
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh, Barry... Barry? Barry! Barrryyyygrrghhh!
PAM: ... my point is, if you're confident in yourself as a woman, who cares if he wants to keep it on the DL?
MALORY: Well yes, but --
PAM: But nothin! Because who's to say you're not using him for sex?
MALORY: Pam, don't take this the wrong way? But you're not nearly as stupid as you look.
PAM: Okay.
ARCHER: Mmmyello?
LANA: Archer don't talk, just listen!
ARCHER: Why, what's up? What're you --
LANA: Jakov's intel is bad and Barry's got some sort of master plan that we're cluele  about, thanks to Cyril --
CYRIL: Who has apologized profusely --
GILLETTE: Quiet game!
LANA: -- so we're gonna regroup at the safehouse and try to... figure out... God damn it.
GILLETTE: What.
LANA: Wait for it.
ARCHER: Ha ha haaaa! Leave it!
JAKOV: Da, da! Keep your shirt on!
BARRY: Barry doesn't wear a shirt. Ruins Barry's whole tracksuit vibe.
MALORY: I swear to God, if he put as much effort into his job as he does into those idiot voicemails... and you say got this from a KGB sleeper?
LANA: Right before Cyril blew his head off.
MALORY: What? !
JAKOV: You son of bitch, you ektually think you will get away with this? !
BARRY: Obviously! Why else would I do it?
JAKOV: Who knows with you, you're crezzy!
BARRY: Am I? ! Between Archer ruining my life and you dicks turning me into a cyborg, I'm kind of amazed I'm even this sane. Which is obviously a relative term, but --
JAKOV: What are you doing?
BARRY: Rationalizing my behavior.
JAKOV: With ge . BARRY: Oh. Killing you.
JAKOV: Oh.
BARRY: Oh, Marmaduke...
JAKOV: End ge  is nut so bad way to die... BARRY: Well again, relative term.
JAKOV: End efterwerd, if Sterlink want, he ken still get some DNA from my body, end find out if I em his real father.
BARRY: Which I'm sure would provide him with some much-needed closure... Which is why it's not gonna happen.
JAKOV: Why, what is thet?
BARRY: This - glad you asked - is a block of ice with a fork frozen in it.
JAKOV: What are you doing with it?
BARRY: I am putting this fork-filled block of ice in this microwave oven... Now I'm setting the timer for five -- Oh heck, let's call it ten minutes. Doesn't matter, ice can't tell time.
JAKOV: It ken unly melt...
BARRY: And when it does...
JAKOV: Spark from fork, gas from stuv... BARRY: Booom.
JAKOV: End no DNA left for papa test...
BARRY: Nope. Just uncertainty and doubt. Which hopefully, over time, will eventually drive Archer insane.
JAKOV: End this, this is your mester plen?
BARRY: Huh? Oh, no, that's this whole other awesome thing. This is just a goof. Later, tater!
JAKOV: Sterlink. If by some miracle this video tep survives the explosion, there is somethink very important I wunt you to know...
PAM: First thing is, yer shitter's clogged.
ARCHER: Don't care, can't feel my legs...
PAM: Second thing is, if you want me to keep doin ya dirty on the down-low --
ARCHER: Yes! Yes yes yes.
PAM: Then we are gonna have some ground rules. To wit!
MALORY: Barry? ! Was here? !
CYRIL: Yeah, but she says he took off after he -- here, you tell her.
CHERYL/CAROL: Okay so, Barry brought me here --
MALORY: How did he know where "here" was?
CHERYL/CAROL: No idea, but so then he strangled me, which at first was hot, he's super strong, but then I was like, floating toward this really bright light and some guy with a beard.
MALORY: Jesus Christ -
CHERYL/CAROL: Or Richie Havens!
MALORY: Nikolai!
JAKOV: End so, Sterlink... remember, things are not always what they appear.
ARCHER: Mmmyello? Hello? Oh for -- Mother this isn't voicemail. Mother, c'mon... The time is... exactly seven sixteen, and I wish they were, but even my voicemail pranks aren't that elaborate. Mother!
MALORY: Sterling?
ARCHER: Leave it... just kidding.
MALORY: Sterling, it's me...
ARCHER: Duh. Where are you, what's all that -- Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. Yeah.
PAM: What's up?
ARCHER: That was um... my uh... the man who might've been my father... just died.
PAM: Awkward.
ARCHER: And it's all my fault, because instead of doing my job, I was here... Half-drunk and having amazing sex.
PAM: Well... I wouldn't say amazing... What? C'mon, you were pushin rope!
