ARCHER: Rat Patrol! God, that was killing me. So yeah, these exact same jeeps, only with fifty-cal machine guns on the back, and the Rat Patrol just tore a  all over North Africa, ha ling Rommel. How did you never see that show?
GILLETTE: I was probably here, digging this goddamn jeep outta this goddamn sand!
ARCHER: Hey don't yell at me, I'm not the idiot who got us stuck!
CYRIL: You were driving! So yes, you are exactly the idiot who got us stuck!
ARCHER: Well whatever, the Rat Patrol drove through way deeper sand than this.
GILLETTE: Ya know...
ARCHER: Although I think one guy's backstory was that he'd been like, a bootlegger? But Kentucky's not all sand-duney, so --
CYRIL: Can you at least get out of the jeep? !
ARCHER: Yes.
GILLETTE: Well? ! ARCHER: Hang on? [BELCHES] But only because taking a dump on Turkmenistan is on my bucket list.
CYRIL: A true citizen of the world.
ARCHER: Right? I mean shut up? Is... damn. Okay, I gue  this'll have to do.
GILLETTE: Noooop!
CYRIL: You're not using the map for that!
ARCHER: Hey, I'm not the idiot who didn't -- I mean, I also didn't think to bring toilet paper, but I'm not, ya know...
GILLETTE: An idiot.
ARCHER: Exactly.
CYRIL: Right, because an idiot wouldn't wipe his a  with our only map.
ARCHER: No, an idiot would wipe his a  with our only compa .
GILLETTE: Wait, which is where? !
ARCHER: Who am I, Lewis and-or Clark?
CYRIL: Archer. ARCHER: Well the last time I saw it was on the bar in the Athens
airport, but -- GILLETTE: God damn it!
ARCHER: Yeah, I doubt it's still there.
CYRIL: [annoyed sigh] ARCHER: A sticky-fingered people, the Greeks.
GILLETTE: Well you're not! Using the map!
ARCHER: Okay! Jesus...
CYRIL: Wh-? Noooo no no no no!
ARCHER: Well it's this or the map, so...
GILLETTE: Great, we'll just tell him his money's out in the desert covered with shit.
ARCHER: There's still ninety-five grand in the bag! And if what's-his-name...
CYRIL: Gorbagun Gorbanguly.
ARCHER: Really?
CYRIL: Yes, really. And you can have a hundred.
ARCHER: What? Cyril, since what, Monday, I've had nothing but ouzo and lamb. C'mon, I need at least a thousand.
CYRIL: Three hundred.
ARCHER: Oh for -- eight hundred!
CYRIL: Five. ARCHER: Seven!
CYRIL: Seven, and you dig out the jeep.
ARCHER: Okay, deal. But I take the map.
CYRIL: No!
We just went over -- ARCHER: To read! Now c'mon, hurry up! The lambs are screaming!
CYRIL: Hey be careful, there might be snakes!
ARCHER: Not even gonna swing at that one.
CYRIL: Ha ha. I'm talking about cobras.
ARCHER: What do you know about cobras, Cyril?
CYRIL: I know the Caspian cobra, which is indigenous to Turkmenistan, is often light brown with darker ventral bands.
ARCHER: Well goody, you win... cobra-knowing.
GILLETTE: Dukes, it's gonna be dark soon. How far is it?
CYRIL: I dunno, I need to look at the -- God damn it, Archer!
ARCHER: What, I said I needed a thousand! Bet three hundred bucks seems pretty cheap for a map right about nyowwww! So hey, so yeah, did you say light brown with darker whateveral bands?
CYRIL: Ventral bands, on -- wait, why?
ARCHER: Eh. Just curious.
MALORY: "Curious" meaning what, exactly?
LANA: Uh, meaning odd or strange?
MALORY: First of all, Turkmenistan isn't -- LANA: Or how about just sexist and stupi --
MALORY: Enough! Please, we've talked about this, it's not even eight-thirty. Let me get settled before you clomp in here in one of your jealous snits.
LANA: One of my -- wait, whoa, clomp?
MALORY: Yes, Lana, clomp, meaning --
LANA: I know what clomp means!
PAM: Your clompin' a  oughta know... LANA: Wh-?
PAM: Seriously, I bet your downstairs neighbors hate you.
LANA: For your information. The Flatows are always incredibly polite to me.
PAM: That's because the Flatows think they live under a frickin AT-AT.
CHERYL/CAROL: Zhwizz-clonk! Zhwizz-clonk!
Zhwizz -- LANA: Okay!
MALORY: Whereas this one, almost impo ibly light on her feet. It's like... if you've ever seen Jackie Gleason dance.
PAM: So, is that a compliment, or --
MALORY: I don't see how it po ibly could be.
PAM: Okay.
MALORY: Nor do I see how you could po ibly think that you're at all suited to a covert mi ion in Turkmenistan.
LANA: Why, because I'm black, or because I'm a woman?
MALORY: Wh-? Pick one! I mean look, I don't want to sound racist, but --
LANA: But you're gonna power through it.
MALORY: Not about you, about Turkmenistan! Lana, this is a Central Asian, maledominated, xenophobic puppet-state whose dictator changed the words for bread and Friday to his dog's name.
CHERYL/CAROL: Gurpgork.
MALORY: Yes, Gurpgor -- how did you know that?
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh my God how did I know that? ! PAM: Okay.
MALORY: And all that crazy is sitting on top of an ocean of oil and natural gas. Making this pipeline crucial to the Ru ians, which is why we're paying Gurbanguly to... hinder construction.
LANA: Wh-? Wait, so now we're paying people to blow up oil pipelines? !
MALORY: See? Another reason I didn't send you.
LANA: What, the environment? !
MALORY: Of what, this litterbox? Or Western Europe? Because T-72 tanks aren't exactly known for their low emi ions.
LANA: I want it officially on record that I am strongly opposed to this mi ion.
MALORY: What record?
PAM: Aww, can I at least put something in the newsletter?
MALORY: Wh-? You're not still doing that? !
PAM: No?
ARCHER: Yes!
GILLETTE: No!
ARCHER: Please! Just pretend I'm -- who's your go-to movie star,
ya know, for -- GILLETTE: Lorne Greene.
ARCHER: Wow.
GILLETTE: Yeah. ARCHER: Bonanza or Battlestar?
GILLETTE: Duh. So, I come to the Ponderosa looking for ranch work, but my
chaps get torn and Hop Sing -- ARCHER: Ray? Time's kind of a factor here.
GILLETTE: I am not. Ever. Sucking your taint.
ARCHER: Okay, so Cyril... Better chapstick it up, buddy.
CYRIL: First of all, not only does sucking out the venom not help the snakebite victim, it can also envenom the --
ARCHER: Taint-sucker, that's you, let's go.
CYRIL: And second of all, the venom's not there anymore, it's pumping through your veins to your heart and brain.
ARCHER: My -- well put a tourniquet on me!
GILLETTE: You can't tourniquet the taint.
ARCHER: But -- wait is my dick gonna be okay? !
CYRIL: Well the danger there is cytotoxins, which can cause severe necrosis.
ARCHER: Nec -- so my dick's gonna fall off? !
CYRIL: Maybe.
ARCHER: Aaagh! CYRIL: But the bigger danger is the neuro and cardiotoxins, which can cause respiratory failure, cardiac arrest --
ARCHER: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
CYRIL: So the most important thing is for you to stay calm.
GILLETTE: Ew. CYRIL: Oh boy...
ARCHER: What, that's good right? If my body's throwing up the poison?
CYRIL: It might be. If you had drunk it.
ARCHER: Jesus H. Thirst, speaking of... Ray, back pocket down there, flask.
CYRIL: Wh-? No, alcohol's a vasodilator! It's the absolute worst po ible thing you can do for a snakebite!
ARCHER: Well maybe for regular people.
CYRIL: ...?!
ARCHER: Cyril, it's already full of cobra venom, now's not the time for any more chemical changes to my blood!
CYRIL: Okay, give it to him.
ARCHER: Wh-? Gimme that!
GILLETTE: Here, baby. ARCHER: It's half empty!
CYRIL: That's still way more than you --
ARCHER: Just shut up and -- Dig. I'm not doing super great.
CYRIL: Well I could use some help!
ARCHER: I would, but I can't feel my hands.
CYRIL: I meant Ray! Who's just standing there... Ray, dammit, on bionic legs!
GILLETTE: Oh right.
ARCHER: God damn it, Ray!
GILLETTE: I forgot! ARCHER: How do you forget you have bionic legs?!
GILLETTE: I, ya know, are you constantly aware you have regular leg bones?!
No, you're -- ARCHER: Just pick up the goddamn jeep!
GILLETTE: He said, suddenly all... pro-bionic. Okay, on three. One, two, threeaagh!
CYRIL: Ray?
ARCHER: What is that, what're you doing? !
GILLETTE: My back my back my back my back... ARCHER: Are you shitting me? ! Bionic legs, and you lifted with your back?! Cyril, my gun's in the gear bag, could you hand it to me, please?
CYRIL: To... use as a signal?
ARCHER: Yeah, maybe. If there's any bullets left after I murder both of you.
CYRIL: Wh-? Why me?!
ARCHER: It's number two on my bucket list.
CYRIL: What's number one?
ARCHER: Going to one of those things where they make some record-breakingly huge kind of food, like a frittata the size of a hockey rink. And then eating a piece, and then laughing, because I murdered you.
MALORY: Krieger, I need you to -- Krieger, Krieger?
KRIEGER: Yep! Yep yep yep!
MALORY: Whatever unspeakable thing you're doing back there
can wait -- KRIEGER: Well, you say that...
MALORY: Yes I do, and I just did, so come on, I need you in the control room. Because they should have checked in by now. So keep trying to reach them on the sat-phone, and if that doesn't work try to get satellite photos on the next pa . And not a word of this to anyone, especially -- Lanaaa! I thought I heard self-righteous clomping. Can I help you?
LANA: Funny, I was just gonna ask you that.
MALORY: No, we're fine. Aren't we, Krieger?
KRIEGER: Yes?
LANA: So, the mi ion? Going as planned?
MALORY: Yes, as a matter of fact they just this minute checked in. All good.
LANA: Uh-huh.
MALORY: "Uh-huh." Ugh, have you ever heard such a superior, know-it-all tone?
KRIEGER: Oh, you're serious?
GILLETTE: Yes!
CYRIL: No!
GILLETTE: Cyril! I can't move, Archer's... Oh. Well, very nearly dead, so --
CYRIL: I'm not calling for an extraction!
GILLETTE: Look, just because Lana makes you feel insecure in
your masculinity -- CYRIL: Mascu -- look who's talking!
GILLETTE: Oh for -- Cyril, when I was ten years old I killed a bear.
CYRIL: Nuh-uh... really?
GILLETTE: With a bow. And then Daddy made me take a big ol' bite out of its heart.
CYRIL: Oh my God! That is... horrible!
GILLETTE: No shit, I was bawling my eyes out. But he kept slapping me until I did it.
CYRIL: Jesus...
ARCHER: Seriously. No wonder you're gay. And Cyril if you call ISIS, I will literally literally, murder you alright. I'd rather die than sit through another one of Lana's big "I told you so's." At least you get to bang her.
GILLETTE: Well, you seem to be feeling better.
ARCHER: Hang on. Gay-vy Crockett, boom, nailed it. But no, I'm pretty sure I'm dying.
GILLETTE: So since you're too pu y to call for an extraction...
CYRIL: I'm digging, I'm digging!
ARCHER: Well wait, hang on. Because unle  I'm hallucinating... There's a Landcruiser over there flipping his highbeams at us.
BOTH: You're hallucinating.
ARCHER: Oh. Well the good news is, we don't have to worry about these alligators. That's not actually good news, is it.
CYRIL: No. No it is not.
ARCHER: Okay... later, gator!
JAMES MASON: No no no no no, what is the meaning of this?!
ESCORT: I'm sorry, James Mason! But he just won't stop tooting that darn tooter!
JAMES MASON: Mr. Archer, I'm afraid I must ask you to cease your insufferable tooting -- This instant.
ARCHER: Fine by me. I hate opera. Almost as much as I hate hoodies, what the hell's going on here?
JAMES MASON: Oh no, not hell, Mr. Archer, this is --
ARCHER: Hey. Cut-rate James Mason. I got kicked out of Episcopal prep school. Twice.
So if there is a heaven -- JAMES MASON: Oh, I'm sorry, nor is this heaven.
ARCHER: Well no, obviously it's not heaven --
JAMES MASON: No, it's a --
ARCHER: -- because Janis Joplin's not giving me a rim job.
JAMES MASON: Way station, I beg your pardon?
ARCHER: Right? Sorry, a cobra bit my taint.
JAMES MASON: Yes.
ARCHER: I'm not myself.
JAMES MASON: Aren't you? ARCHER: Are I?
JAMES MASON: Are you, indeed. Would you like to know who Sterling Archer really is?
ARCHER: No?
LANA: Why not? Why won't you guys stand up to Malory with me about blowing up the pipeline?
PAM: Mmmmmmmmmmmcuz we don't give a shit?
LANA: About the earth?!
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh please, if you really cared you'd resign, but there's no way you ever will because you're just counting the days until, her face bloated and yellow from liver failure, she calls you to her deathbed and, in a croaky whisper, explains that Mr. Archer is totally incompetent and that you, the long-suffering Lana Kane, are the only one qualified to run ISIS, and you weep shameful tears, because you know this terrible place is the only true love you will ever know.
LANA: Excuse me.
PAM: Daaamn...
CHERYL/CAROL: What? Oh my God, was I talking?
CYRIL: Who the... hell is he... talking to?
ARCHER: James Mason...
CYRIL: Oh.
GILLETTE: Maybe that's his Lorne Greene. ARCHER: James Mason, why are we in Baltimore?!
JAMES MASON: I thought you might like some insight into how you became the man you are.
ARCHER: No, I would absolutely not like some --
JAMES MASON: Sterling Archer, age eighteen...
ARCHER: The most recruited prep school lacro e player in America...
JAMES MASON: Visiting Baltimore for the weekend, to decide if he will accept a full athletic scholarship to Johns Hopkins.
ARCHER: Whooooo! Yeah, so we don't need to see how...
JAMES MASON: At a stop on the train ride from New York you struck out the major league homerun champion, Slammer Sloan.
ARCHER: Whooooo!
ARCHER: Well obviously, I was awesome, but I --
JAMES MASON: Drew the attention of a beautiful woman named Ruth Ann Litzenberger... Qui était, vraiment, une femme fatale. And who followed you here, to this very hotel in Baltimore, and sent you a note, to come to her room...
ARCHER: Look, seriously -- Woooooo! Wait, how did you know I was staying -- What's going on here?
RUTH ANN: Sterling? Will you be the best there ever was in the game?
ARCHER: Wh-?!
YOUNG ARCHER: Uh...
ARCHER: Noooo!
YOUNG ARCHER: Duh. ARCHER: Yeah, sooo... I don't know if you're deaf or just an a hole or both, but I'm pretty sure I said I didn't wanna see this.
JAMES MASON: But Sterling, do you not see how the actions of a deeply disturbed woman have profoundly influenced your life?
ARCHER: Well obviously! I mean -- Oh, you mean my lacro e career ending because a crazy stalker gut-shot me.
JAMES MASON: Do I?
ARCHER: I don't know, James Mason! Do you?! Besides, what freakin' movie is this? What's next, Mr. Gower slaps me deaf?! C'mon, you're all over the road here!
CYRIL: Well?!
ARCHER: Well what?!
CYRIL: I'm doing the best I can!
GILLETTE: If that's the best you can do -- gaagh! Just kill your -- gaagh! Wh-? Are you bouncing on purpose? !
CYRIL: No, I'm trying to get Archer to whatever pa es for a doctor around here before it's too late!
ARCHER: Sounds like a plan, James Mason.
CYRIL: And maybe if you shut up I can concentrate on the rowaaaghhhhh!
GILLETTE: Gaagh! What the shit was that? !
CYRIL: A camel.
GILLETTE: Well great, now we've both killed a large animal! Drive around it!
CYRIL: I, uh... don't think that's an option.
ARCHER: Hey check it out, Fred and Barney, we're at the Water Buffalo Lodge!
MALORY: Krieger, any word from Sterling?
KRIEGER: Yep! Yep yep yep!
MALORY: Well? What did they say?
KRIEGER: Oh. I mean nope. Nope nope nope.
MALORY: [annoyed sigh] KRIEGER: But, ya know, I'm sure they're fine.
CYRIL: Wait, no! I had the right of way!
GILLETTE: Gaagh!
GILLETTE: Seriously, I get that you're upset but I think I have a pinched nnngghhh!
GILLETTE: Gaaagh!
CYRIL: Now just a darn minute! We're Americ -- Hello...
GILLETTE: Yeah. Way to not call it in.
JAMES MASON: I beg your pardon?
ARCHER: Yeah, you should. And I'm outta here.
JAMES MASON: I'm afraid that isn't po ible.
ARCHER: Oh really?
And why is -- AMBULANCE DRIVER: Comin through! C'mon, make a hole!
YOUNG ARCHER: Phrasing, boom.
ARCHER: Boom. Scholarship to Johns Hopkins.
JAMES MASON: Mmm. Bit of a moot point though, really, given your SAT scores.
ARCHER: Goodbye, James Mason.
JAMES MASON: No, you -- Mr. Archer, wait!
CYRIL: Please, here! Here's forty-three hundred dollars, surely that's enough for a camel.
TURKMEN CHIEF: Ah, baksheesh!
CYRIL: Baksheesh, exactly, but our friend... okay, snake is... oh, okay, so "Our friend was bitten by a snake" is... Ozum jora? Bishlemek gurpgork?
TURKMEN CHIEF: Etmek bishlemek gurpgork.
CYRIL: Wh-? No, no! I mean... Yok,yok.
JAMES MASON: No, no!
JAMES MASON: Mr. Archer, please!
ARCHER: You please, cut-rate James Mason! And then shut up, because I'm going...
ARCHER: Home. Goddammit. Or... what is it?
CYRIL: Gurpgork!
TURKMEN CHIEF: Ah! Gowushmak eshek gurpgork!
CYRIL: Wh-? No! Yok! Not that Gurpgork! (Makes claw, growls) Rawr, rawr!
TURKMEN CHIEF: Ah, Gurpgork! Patysha alabai!
TURKMENI: Ah, Gurpgork! Hawa hawa! Gurpgork!
TURKMEN CHIEF: Gurpgork.
CYRIL: [deeply weary sigh] GILLETTE: How's it the same word for bread and snake and Friday and that damn dog?!
CYRIL: How the hell should I know?!
MALORY: Because you have an entire satellite array at your disposal, you idiot!
KRIEGER: Yeah, I don't actually know how any of this works.
MALORY: But -- KRIEGER: That was the fat guy, you killed.
LANA: Oh, and just so you know? I do know what true love is, so... yeah.
MALORY: What in God's name was that about?
KRIEGER: She'd probably ruin the wedding.
ARCHER: Come on, what the hell is this?
JAMES MASON: I thought you'd like to see something. ARCHER: I've seen poverty, I've been to -- oh, how's it going in Turkmenistan?
JAMES MASON: Mmmmm, not great.
TURKMENI [excited chattering] GILLETTE: Cyril, just draw a snake!
CYRIL: Oh right.
CYRIL: Okay, uh... doo doo doo... elliptical head, oblique dorsal scales, symmetric sub-caudal scalation, darker ventral bands, obviously... okay, here we go.
CYRIL: Wh-? What is wrong with you people?!
GILLETTE: What's wrong with you? Gimme that!
GILLETTE: Here! Tada. A Snake!
CYRIL: Oh that's crap...
TURKMENI [alarmed gasp] TURKMEN CHIEF: Gurpgork?! Dishlemek gurpgork?!
CYRIL: I -- wanna say duh, but...
ARCHER: What's the point?
ARCHER: C'mon, this is stupid, I don't need to see this, I remember all of it.
JAMES MASON: Do you?
CHILD ARCHER: Yeah...
ARCHER: Yeah I mean, that's me, I'm like... Six. I'm six today, it's my birthday.
JAMES MASON: And your Mother isn't home, is she?
ARCHER: No, she had to -- look, Guatemala's democratically elected government wasn't gonna overthrow itself.
JAMES MASON: Mmm. And with Woodhouse, shall we say, indisposed...
WOODHOUSE: [heroin-induced snoring]
JAMES MASON: There was no one to give you a birthday present.
ARCHER: I... wait, no, yeah, I got...
TURKMEN CHIEF: Derman! Derman gurpgork! Derman gurpgork etmek!
GILLETTE: No, I don't think he can keep bread down...
CYRIL: No, I think it's -- Derman is medicine!
TURKMEN CHIEF: Derman gurpgork! CYRIL: I think it's antivenom! Gimme!
TURKMEN CHIEF: Yok, yok! Kop kop kop baksheesh.
CYRIL: Oh. He wants a lot lot lot of money.
GILLETTE: So? We've got ninety-five grand!
CYRIL: But that's for the mi ion, to --
GILLETTE: Blow up a frickin oil pipeline?
CYRIL: Wait, really?
GILLETTE: Cyril, what did you think she meant by
"hinder construction?" CYRIL: Oh. Do you ever think maybe we're kinda not always a hundred percent of the time doing the right thing?
GILLETTE: Do you ever shut up and give that man-bear twenty-five grand so you and I can split the other seventy?
CYRIL: Yes, yes I do.
ARCHER: I got a... yeah, I got an alligator!
CHILD ARCHER: [tiny gasp] MYSTERY MAN: Hello, Sterling.
MYSTERY MAN: Your mother doesn't know I'm here, but I wanted to bring you a birthday present. I hope you like alligators.
CHILD ARCHER: I do...
ARCHER: I did...
CHILD ARCHER: Thank you, sir. But... who are you?
MYSTERY MAN: Sterling, I... am your real father.
CHILD ARCHER: [small gasp] ARCHER: [huge gasp]
CYRIL: Archer?
ARCHER: Buck Henry?
Oh my God, Cyril! Ray! I know -- CYRIL: You're okay!
We gave you the antivenom -- ARCHER: Cyril shut your dickhole! Jesus God, I know who my real father was!
GILLETTE: Well? !
CYRIL: Who was he? !
ARCHER: He... was... da gone... uh... No, it's gone. Goddammit.
