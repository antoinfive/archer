ARCHER: And so, here is what I propose... We finish these, get some roadies, head back to my huge penthouse, drink chilled champagne served by my valet...
WOMAN: Isn't it pronounced valet?
ARCHER: Only if he's parking your car, then we slip into my new hot tub and, ya know, see where the evening takes us.
WOMAN: Well, I have to wait until my friend comes back from the powder room...
ARCHER: Well yeah, obviously we're gonna wait for her, she's the hot one.
WOMAN: Pig! ARCHER: I'm sorry, is something funny?
MAN: Just that last part, where she slapped you.
ARCHER: Yeah? ! You like physical humor? !
MAN: Depends on the situation.
ARCHER: Ow.
MAN: You okay?
ARCHER: No, I'm not oh -- oh my God! You're Burt Reynolds!
BURT REYNOLDS: Yes, yes I am. And if I let you up, are you gonna do anything stupid?
ARCHER: No, no I'm not. Hi, Sterling Archer.
BURT REYNOLDS: Sterling Archer?
ARCHER: Yeah, you've heard of me, huh?
BURT REYNOLDS: Well, just from your -- ARCHER: Pre  clippings, yeah, it's pretty hard to stay anonymous when you're the world's greatest secret agent.
BURT REYNOLDS: Calling yourself that can't help.
ARCHER: Hang on, true story, Operation CIA? That movie's basically why I became a secret agent in the first place!
BURT REYNOLDS: Really? That movie was just god-awful.
ARCHER: What's awful is I almost punched you!
BURT REYNOLDS: No you didn't.
ARCHER: And I've seen all your other movies like five times! Sam Whiskey, Navajo Joe, Fuzz, Hooper, Shamus, Shark, The Longest Yard, Deliverance, The Smokies, White Lightning, obviously Gator, uh, oh! I even saw At Long Last Love! I thought you were great!
BURT REYNOLDS: Really.
ARCHER: Well, I wanted to.
BURT REYNOLDS: Me too. Listen, I kinda have a date.
ARCHER: No no no wait wait wait! Sorry. Lemme buy you a drink, I wanna tell you my idea for a Gator sequel!
BURT REYNOLDS: Gator was a sequel.
ARCHER: I Know, and this will be the final chapter in The McClusky Trilogy!
BURT REYNOLDS: Trilogy. Huh. ARCHER: With twice as many airboats as Gator!
BURT REYNOLDS: Twice as many would be none?
ARCHER: What're you talking about, Gator had --
BURT REYNOLDS: Speedboats. Not airboats.
ARCHER: Really, are you sure?
BURT REYNOLDS: Pretty sure. I directed it.
ARCHER: I -- okay, but this one has airboats,
and they're central to the plot, BURT REYNOLDS: And it sounds great, kid, but like I said, I kinda have a date, so...
ARCHER: I get it. You gonna take her upstairs and give her "the longest yard"?
MALORY: Yoo-hooooo!
ARCHER: Mother? ! What are you doing here? !
MALORY: What are you doing here? !
ARCHER: I'm kickin it with -- Burt? Oh no...
BURT REYNOLDS: Yeah so... remember how I said I kinda had a date? It's kinda with your mom. Hope that's not gonna be a problem.
MALORY: Oh please! Burt Reynolds didn't give you a black eye, the floor did! When you fainted like a schoolgirl!
ARCHER: It was an involuntary reaction, mother! To seeing you all tarted up to meet my hero in a hotel bar for sex!
MALORY: Oh for -- we were meeting for drinks! I mean obviously sex was implied, but --
ARCHER: Ugh!
MALORY: And since when is he your hero?
ARCHER: Wh-? Since always!
YOUNG ARCHER: Eeeast bound and doowwn! MALORY: I thought that was Richard Petty.
ARCHER: Which doesn't even merit a response. And you cannot date Burt Reynolds!
MALORY: Can, am, and will continue to do so.
ARCHER: I'm serious, I'll do something drastic!
MALORY: You will not. Mainly because you've got bigger things to worry about.
ARCHER: I'll be the judge of -- a Cuban hit squad is in New York to kill me? !
MALORY: Apparently.
ARCHER: This intel's a week old! Why are you just telling me about it now? !
MALORY: Because... Pick up Sterling, pick up, pick --
ARCHER: Mmyello?
MALORY: Sterling dear, it's me. There's a --
ARCHER: Ha! Voicemail. You know what to do.
MALORY: Oh for God's sake.
ARCHER: Hello?
MALORY: Sterling, dear it's me. ARCHER: Hold on, hold on! Hang on.
MALORY: Sterling.
ARCHER: Don't hang up. Hello.
MALORY: Sterling it's --
ARCHER: Elaborate voicemail hoax. Leave it.
MALORY: And then I just sort of forgot about it, because that same night, I met --
CHERYL/CAROL: Burt Reynoooolds! Is on line oooone! For you, for some reason.
MALORY: Burt dear, what a lovely surprise!
BURT REYNOLDS: I'm sitting here with just a mustache and memories of last night.
MALORY: Oh, Burt...
ARCHER: Rrrgh!
BURT REYNOLDS: and also a blanket. The AC in my room's stuck on... freeze.
CHERYL/CAROL: Deliverance, Gator, and this is him in Cosmoooh! How totally hot is he? !
PAM: I swear to God, you could drown a toddler in my panties right now. I mean not that you would, but --
CHERYL/CAROL: Hey!
ARCHER: Shut up!
CHERYL/CAROL: You're not my supervisor! Wait, who is my supervis --
MALORY: Carol!
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh right.
MALORY: Go get my gray fox out of cold storage. Burt Reynolds is taking me to a movie premiere tonight, so -- help me God, if you throw that computer on the floor again you'll wake up in a mental ward with total amnesia under someone else's name.
PAM: That's actually kinda scary.
CHERYL/CAROL: Eh. Wouldn't be the first time.
CYRIL: Archer, hey, about this expense report --
ARCHER: Not now, Cyril! Mother is ruining what remains of my life before a Cuban hit squad a a inates me, so --
LANA: MÃ¡talo!
ARCHER: Wh-? ! Yeah laugh it up, Lana.
LANA: I am.
ARCHER: You almost got shot in the face. Get off.
CYRIL: You get off.
ARCHER: Cyril. I'm pretty tense right now.
LANA: Because of the Cubans? Or because Burt Reynolds is doing your mom?
ARCHER: Yeah, laugh it up!
CYRIL: I am! Burt Reynolds is actually banging --
LANA: Archer!
CYRIL: You broke my frickin nose!
ARCHER: What's that? Sorry, I can't hear you over the sound of I broke your nose! LANA: Bullying Cyril isn't gonna make Burt Reynolds stop shtupping your mom.
ARCHER: He's not... doing that!
LANA: But even if he is, which he is --
ARCHER: No he isn't! LANA: This Cuban hit squad is no joke. So if I were you, I'd lay low in the safehouse for a few days, until we work out a plan to neutralize them.
ARCHER: Ohh! Yeah, okay! The safehouse!
LANA: I'm sorry, your words made sense, but your sarcastic tone did not.
ARCHER: Because there are no Cubans! Mother just wants me out of the way so she can... do unspeakable things with Burt Reynolds! So nice try, idiot!
LANA: I love it that I'm the idiot...
MALORY: So unle  the building is literally on fire, none of you are to call me. Because, as I may have mentioned --
CYRIL: Fifty times.
MALORY: -- tonight I will be attending a movie premiere with Burt Reynolds.
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh my God, that totally reminds me! This came for you. From him.
MALORY: And you opened it? !
CHERYL/CAROL: That's how I knew it was from him.
MALORY: Give me that!
"Dear Malory, it's been --" LANA: Dear Malory, it's been real, but I'm dumping you for a young starlet and heading back to Tinseltown. Do not contact me. Regards, Burt Reynolds.
MALORY: "Regards!" They weren't even warmest!
LANA: Wait a -- who calls it Tinseltown?
GILLETTE: Carol Channing?
LANA: Or somebody who just thinks that's what movie stars call Hollywood.
KRIEGER: Stockard Channing? LANA: Archer. His mother, dating his mancrush? I bet Archer kidnapped him.
CHERYL/CAROL: But how?
LANA: Archer goes to Burt's hotel room... Knocks him out...
CHERYL/CAROL: Archer? Knocks out Burt Reynolds? !
LANA: With gas...
BURT REYNOLDS: Oh shit.
LANA: And then hides him somewhere. Like an idiot kid hiding a lamp he broke.
PAM: You really think he'd do that?
ARCHER: Yes, really. I'm serious, if you ever go near to my mother again I will... do something really bad.
BURT REYNOLDS: Well, then you should probably just go ahead and get it over with.
ARCHER: Don't worry, I -- wait, what?
BURT REYNOLDS: Because if you don't kill me, and I get loose? You're gonna wish you were in hell with your back broke.
ARCHER: I don't... have a response to that.
BURT REYNOLDS: They never do...
MALORY: It's my own fault, I should've known! They tell you they love you, and then they just cast you aside when some young starlet catches their eye, with her perky little boobs!
CHERYL/CAROL: I bet they were perky and big. Jeezow!
PAM: Why are you torturing her like that? !
CHERYL/CAROL: Why are you asking rhetorical questions?
KRIEGER: Aww, that's actually kinda sad...
LANA: Allright, here's the plan, I say we go rescue Burt Reynolds, and as a bonus, beat some sense into Archer's head and a .
CYRIL: Yeah! Right in the head and a !
LANA: So Pam, Carol, stay here with Malory. Everybody else, let's go to Archer's.
GILLETTE: He's got a Cuban hit squad after him. Why wouldn't he go to the safehouse?
LANA: A, because he thinks they're imaginary, and B, the safehouse doesn't have a --
ARCHER: New hot tub! Fifty jets, hand-hewn California Redwood, no big deal...
BURT REYNOLDS: The California Redwood is endangered.
ARCHER: So? I already got my tub. Woodhouse, Burt Reynolds. Burt, Woodhouse.
BURT REYNOLDS: Hi.
WOODHOUSE: Loved you in Gone With The Wind.
ARCHER: Not him, shut up, get him a drink. What's your poison?
BURT REYNOLDS: Pimm's Cup?
ARCHER: Odd choice...
BURT REYNOLDS: Well, this whole thing's pretty odd. ARCHER: What's odd! Is you wanting to date my mother!
BURT REYNOLDS: Why's that odd?
ARCHER: Because you're you! And she's, um...
BURT REYNOLDS: Beautiful, smart, funny, succe ful...
ARCHER: Like, one of those, tops.
BURT REYNOLDS: Not to mention drop-dead sexy.
WOODHOUSE: Oh dear God yes.
ARCHER: Woodhouse!
WOODHOUSE: I shall fetch a cucumber! ARCHER: You have to not date my mother.
BURT REYNOLDS: Can't do it.
ARCHER: Can't, or --
BURT REYNOLDS: Won't, whatever, pick one. ARCHER: Well then, here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna drink your Pimm's Cup...
BURT REYNOLDS: Which is exciting! Never had one!
ARCHER: Then I'm gonna knock you out, and you're gonna wake up in a mental hospital with total amnesia, under someone else's name.
BURT REYNOLDS: Hey, now there's an idea for a movie!
ARCHER: Yeah, I think it already was.
BURT REYNOLDS: I wasn't in it. ARCHER: Well, maybe not, but --
BURT REYNOLDS: Fade in! A mental ward! White walls, white sheets, nurses in crisp white uniforms, broken men shuffle like zombies we see a hospital wristband on a man's arm, John Doe. And we slowly tilt up, to see the man's face... Gator McClusky. And he's looking out the window, the afternoon sun on his face, and there's a spark of recognition in his eyes, cause you know what he's looking at?
ARCHER: No...
BURT REYNOLDS: The Okefenokee Swamp.
ARCHER: There's a mental hospital there?
BURT REYNOLDS: Right on the water. And gue  what's tied up right out there at the dock?
ARCHER: An airboat! And the head nurse falls in love with him and finds out who he really is so she helps him escape and they get chased by a bunch of dirty cops but in the end they win!
BURT REYNOLDS: And you just got a screenplay credit.
ARCHER: For real? !
BURT REYNOLDS: Oh yeah, maybe even --
WOODHOUSE: Your Pimm's Cup, sir.
BURT REYNOLDS: Doesn't it... come in a silver chalice?
WOODHOUSE: Ah. That would be a pimp cup, sir.
BURT REYNOLDS: Ohh... I hate to sound Hollywood, but could you put my Pimm's Cup in a --
WOODHOUSE: Pimp Cup! Certainly! It would be an honor, Mr. Gable!
ARCHER: Maybe even what? !
BURT REYNOLDS: Executive Producer.
ARCHER: Executive producer? ! But I'm not... Falling for that! You big liar! You're not gonna make that movie!
BURT REYNOLDS: Oh, I absolutely am. And once your ISIS buddies find out that you kidnapped me and come find me, I'm gonna give them all an EP credit.
ARCHER: No, you're not! So drink your stupid Pimm's Cup --
BURT REYNOLDS: Yeah, where are we on that chalice?
ARCHER: Because nobody is coming for you, Burt! And especially nobody from ISIS!
LANA: Okay, don't take this the wrong way? But I'm kinda wondering how you're gonna be an effective field agent.
GILLETTE: Interesting. Coming from a woman.
LANA: Excuse me?
KRIEGER: Burn!
CUBAN ONE: Eh? Esto es Archer, no?
CUBAN TWO: Creo que sÃ­, pero... esta paralizado?
CUBAN ONE: Al parecer. Sera mas fÃ¡cil, eh? El invÃ¡lido. MÃ¡talo!
GILLETTE: I mean don't get me wrong, I'm all for affirmative action, but --
LANA: Oh my God! Okay, first of all --
CYRIL: Hey guys?
KRIEGER: Hey guys? LANA: Zip it nerds! First of all, I was twice the agent you were when your legs worked, so don't hand me that --
GILLETTE: Shit!
LANA: What the --
GILLETTE: Duck! LANA: And this conversation isn't over!
GILLETTE: Isn't it? !
KRIEGER: No no no no! My brand-new van!
ARCHER: Holy shit! Lana! Hang on! Cuban hit squad! I gotta go!
LANA: Would you go? !
KRIEGER: I can't yet!
GILLETTE: And now I do actually see your point.
CYRIL: Krieger, go!
CUBAN ONE: iVamonos! ARCHER: Damn! Krieger can't outrun anything with all that handicapped shit. I gotta go after them! But this conversation is not over!
BURT REYNOLDS: You'll never catch 'em.
ARCHER: Yes I will!
BURT REYNOLDS: No you won't. I've seen you drive. You drive like an egg.
ARCHER: You think you can outdrive me? !
BURT REYNOLDS: And I'll bet on it.
ARCHER: Go on...
BURT REYNOLDS: If I don't catch 'em, I will just ride off into the sunset... ARCHER: Where they don't have telephones to ever call my mother again, ever.
BURT REYNOLDS: On my word. And if I do catch 'em...
ARCHER: You keep dating my mother, yeah, got it. And since we've wasted a shitload of time already, I feel pretty good about this bet. So let's do thiiis! [ Elevator Music ]
BURT REYNOLDS: You're kidding me.
ARCHER: I know, it drives me nuts. It's like the world's slowest elevator.
LANA: This is like the world's slowest van!
KRIEGER: It's all this handicapped shit!
GILLETTE: Jesus God, I get! Your point!
BURT REYNOLDS: You should get a bat-pole.
ARCHER: Nine thousand bucks.
BURT REYNOLDS: What? ARCHER: Lowest quote I got.
BURT REYNOLDS: That's ridiculous.
ARCHER: For basically just putting a pole where the garbage chute already is, but the co-op board was like "But what'll we do with the garbage?"
BURT REYNOLDS: Yeah, but you can still throw it down the, whatever, the same shaft.
ARCHER: I know.
BURT REYNOLDS: And then you'd have some garbage to land on. ARCHER: If you're coming in hot, I know, it's a win-win.
BURT REYNOLDS: And you were gonna pay for it yourself, no a e ment or anything.
ARCHER: Yep.
BURT REYNOLDS: Ridiculous. ARCHER: Preaching to the choir, buddy.
BURT REYNOLDS: That's not your car, is it?
ARCHER: Yeah, why?
BURT REYNOLDS: Nothing, just... Didn't know they sold those to men.
ARCHER: Yeah, laugh it up, Burt.
BURT REYNOLDS: I am.
ARCHER: Aaaaaaaawwww shiiiiiiiiiiit! Burt it's too fast! Too fast!
BURT REYNOLDS: No such thing.
ARCHER: Yes such thing! Slow down!
BURT REYNOLDS: Don't you wanna help your friends?
ARCHER: I don't care about them!
BURT REYNOLDS: Yes you do. You just pretend you don't, because you're afraid of --
ARCHER: Dying in this frickin car!
BURT REYNOLDS: Emotional intimacy.
ARCHER: Oh my God, you --
LANA: You are such an a hole!
ARCHER: Lana? ! Lana, we're coming to help, where are you? ! LANA: Heading north on the FDR at... 60th! Getting shot at by your damn Cubans!
KRIEGER: Which is totally not cool!
BURT REYNOLDS: Great! Tell her to keep going north!
ARCHER: Doesn't matter, we can't catch them, we're all the way acrawww shiiiit!
BURT REYNOLDS: We'll catch 'em. I know a shortcut.
ARCHER: Wh-? How? !
BURT REYNOLDS: I did a TV series here called Hawk.
ARCHER: I forgot about Hawk.
BURT REYNOLDS: He was part Indian. ARCHER: Right!
BURT REYNOLDS: Whoo! Now it's officially a chase!
ARCHER: Hooray...
BURT REYNOLDS: You know what your problem is?
ARCHER: My pants are wet?
BURT REYNOLDS: You only see your mother as your mother. But she's also a person. She has hopes, dreams, fears... needs.
ARCHER: Don't make it weirder!
BURT REYNOLDS: Not sexual needs - well, maybe those too - but personal, profe ional, all the stuff that makes a person who they are. And until you -- oops, hang on.
ARCHER: Holy shit, Burt Reynolds!
BURT REYNOLDS: Hey, if you'd pay attention you might just learn something here.
ARCHER: I'm sorry, I can't hear you over the sound of my giant throbbing erection. Owww!
BURT REYNOLDS: How bout now?
ARCHER: It's gone, I'm all ears.
BURT REYNOLDS: Good. Because my point is... oh wait, wait, you're gonna wanna see this.
ARCHER: See wh -- no! Burt noooo! Please don't do this. Oh shit! My pants are now literally wet.
BURT REYNOLDS: And my point is, until you can look at your mother and see her not just as your mother but as a person, a real person... you can't grow up.
ARCHER: Huh.
BURT REYNOLDS: Food for thought. And if I were you I'd come to terms with that, because I plan on seeing a lot of her. And uh, by "a lot of her" I mean --
ARCHER: I get it! But I gue  you're outta luck, because we had a -- Bet. God damn it.
BURT REYNOLDS: Now whaddya say we have some fun?
ARCHER: Whatever...
KRIEGER: Oh my God, not the van. LANA: Will you please! Drive straight!
GILLETTE: No, serpentine, serpentine!
HOLOGRAM HENTAI BRIDE: Oh! Herroooh!
CYRIL: Herroh...
LANA: Holy shit! It's Burt Reynolds!
BURT REYNOLDS: iBuenas! Now watch what I do right here.
ARCHER: Yeah duh, I only invented it.
BURT REYNOLDS: Oh. Nice to meet you, Hal Needham.
ARCHER: Whatever.
BURT REYNOLDS: Ha haaaaa!
ARCHER: That was actually pretty sweet.
BURT REYNOLDS: Uh-oh, looks like we're in danger of a frown turning upside-down... ARCHER: Cut it out, that tickles. Burt c'mon, seriously, cut it out -- Burt watch the goddamn road!
BURT REYNOLDS: Oh shit. Sorry about that.
ARCHER: You should be, that was totally irresp -- Wait, was that the same footage?
LANA: Thanks, Burt!
BURT REYNOLDS: Anytime, darlin! But uh, you probably wanna go ahead and slow down...
LANA: Oh, shit! Krieger, braaaakes!
KRIEGER: I am! They're not doing anything!
LANA: A round must've cut the brake line!
BURT REYNOLDS: That's okay, I got it!
ARCHER: What do you mean you gawww shiiit! Um...
BURT REYNOLDS: Hang on, everybody! Everybody okay?
KRIEGER: Okay? ! No, we're not okay! Look at vanispheres!
HOLOGRAM: No, we okay...
KREIGER: Dont you touch me!
BURT REYNOLDS: What -- is that a ghost?
LANA: No, it's -- never mind. We're good. Thank you, Burt.
BURT REYNOLDS: Oh don't thank me, thank -- oh, right. Now if you'll excuse me, I think we can still make that movie premiere.
ARCHER: You're taking me to the premiere? !
MALORY: Leave me for some hot little twenty year-old. Well, I'll show him. I'll go find a ten year-old.
CHERYL/CAROL: Ew. Yeah, I don't think you wanna do that.
MALORY: Shut up.
PAM: Okay, taxiiii!
MALORY: Yooou!
BURT REYNOLDS: Malory wait, I can explain -- MALORY: Save it! Nobody wants your, your --
ARCHER: Mother, Burt didn't --
MALORY: -- mustache rides around here, buster!
ARCHER: Mother! Ugh, listen, Burt didn't write that note. I did.
MALORY: You what.
ARCHER: I know, I'm sorry, I -- Oww! Oww!
MALORY: What is wrong with you? !
BURT REYNOLDS: A lot, actually. He's kind of a me .
MALORY: I am too, look at me, raccoon eyes...
BURT REYNOLDS: I think you look beautiful. And I, for one, would love to walk you down the red carpet.
MALORY: And I, for one, would be delighted.
ARCHER: Have a good time, Mother. And I honestly mean that.
MALORY: Oh blow it out yer a .
CHERYL/CAROL: Burt Reynolds is so freakin awesome.
ARCHER: Yeah... yeah he actually kind of is.
PAM: And, I for one, am gonna go watch Hooper and masturbate til my fingers bleed.
CHERYL/CAROL: Just tape 'em up.
