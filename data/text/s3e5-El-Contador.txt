ARCHER: C'mon Cyril, beat it, get outta here.
ARCHER: This meeting's for field agents only.
MALORY: Which brings me to item one. We don't have enough field agents to effectively run our covert operations. Especially since this one went and got himself paralyzed.
GILLETTE: Yeah that's me, Mr. Selfish.
MALORY: More like Ms. Anyway, effective immediately, I'm promoting Cyril to field agent.
LANA: What? !
GILLETTE: Do what? !
ARCHER: Hey, that sounds great, best of luck.
MALORY: Where do you think you're going? ARCHER: Oh, sorry, I gotta get back to Earth before the Stargate closes.
MALORY: Get back in here!
ARCHER: Mother the chevrons are locking!
LANA: And Cyril is utterly, laughably unqualified to be a field agent! Some offense.
CYRIL: Some taken.
MALORY: Well, none of you were qualified when you first started. And you've already given Cyril some training...
ARCHER: Which ended with a dead hooker in my trunk!
CYRIL: No it didn't!
ARCHER: It easily could have! LANA: Malory, you can't just --
MALORY: End! Of discu ion. And since this meeting is for field agents only...
GILLETTE: You're taking me out of the field? !
MALORY: Well, unle  we need someone to go undercover as a shopping cart.
GILLETTE: [annoyed sigh] MALORY: This is Román Calzado, the notorious Colombian drug lord. And hopefully an infusion of much-needed capital.
LANA: Since when are we bounty hunters?
MALORY: Since the DEA's budget was gutted by all those federal spending cutbacks.
CYRIL: Which is ridiculous, given the current economy. The most efficient way to decrease the budget deficit is to increase tax revenue, through, um...
MALORY: Cyril don't make me regret this decision.
CYRIL: Sorry.
MALORY: And if you were in my tax bracket you wouldn't be spouting that socialist propaganda.
ARCHER: Or wearing such shitty clothes.
LANA: Or doing such shitty mi ions!
MALORY: What are you talking about? The reward is a million dollars!
LANA: Exactly, and how many drug users could be treated with that money?
MALORY: Who cares? !
LANA: Seriously? !
ARCHER: Lana, they'd just go buy a million dollars worth of crack with it. LANA: You don't give them the money.
ARCHER: You can't, they'll blow it on crack.
LANA: Oh my God...
MALORY: No they won't, because it'll in the ISIS bank account. Because you're going to get Calzado, dead or alive. And Cyril, dre  appropriately, you'll be helicoptering into the jungle.
CYRIL: Coool...
MALORY: Oh, and this whole thing reminds me... Pam? Nine AM Friday morning, all ISIS employees will take a drug test.
PAM: Nkay.
MALORY: And knock off that damn beatboxing!
MALORY: Ugh. Last week it was freestyling.
ARCHER: Yes, this LZ! You dumba ! Where we are right now! In twenty-four hours! And you better be here! What a dick.
LANA: Well he's probably just under a lot of stre . Since he's our only way out of this stupid jungle! Dumba !
CYRIL: Seriously...
ARCHER: Thanks, ghost of Teddy Roosevelt.
CYRIL: Ms. Archer said dre  for the tropics! ARCHER: Tropics or Busch Gardens?
CYRIL: Hey, ya know what? !
ARCHER: Yes.
LANA: Heckle? Jeckle? Between us and Calzado's fortified compound there's about ten clicks of jungle that I just a ume is one giant booby-trap showroom. So shut your dickholes, get your gear, shut up again, and start walking. Any questions? Cyril.
CYRIL: What's a click.
ARCHER: Yeah you say that all the time and I never know what you're talking about. I'm a uming it's a sound of some sort?
CHERYL/CAROL: Nuh-uhh!
PAM: Swear to God, first thing Friday morning we all gotta pee in a cup -
GILLETTE: Which I can't even do... y'all PAM: Cleaning out my freezer last week, found a big bag of skank. I gue  I brought it back from Jamaica, but --
CHERYL/CAROL: But it's just a pot test, right? !
PAM: No, stupid. All drugs.
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh shit. I call 'em groovi bears.
PAM: How bout you, Ironsides? You rollin dirty?
GILLETTE: Umm... Po ibly.
PAM: Well then we're all screwed.
KRIEGER: Talking about the drug test, huh?
CHERYL/CAROL: Duh.
KRIEGER: Well -- What if I told you I had a way to beat any drug test in the world.
PAM: Are you telling us that?
KRIEGER: Yes.
CHERYL/CAROL: Well? What is it? !
KRIEGER: I call it... Krieger-Kleanse. It's an herbal tea, all-natural, and it's guaranteed to rid your body of all traces of any illicit substance.
PAM: Well here, gimme gimme give it!
KRIEGER: Ah ah ahh! I literal - figuratively scoured the globe for these special herbs, at no small expense to myself.
CHERYL/CAROL: Ugh. How much.
KRIEGER: Hundred bucks each.
EVERYBODY: [ Complaining ] KRIEGER: Or you can save your money, and try your luck in the current job market. Non-sequential bills, please.
ARCHER: Well then why not just say kilometer?
LANA: Because shut up.
ARCHER: Jungle ziiing... CYRIL: So it says here that Calzado isn't even the head of the whole operation...
LANA: Cyril.
CYRIL: He's actually just a distributor for somebody named La Sombra. The Shade?
LANA: Cyril.
CYRIL: No, I bet in this context, The Shadow.
LANA: Cyril. CYRIL: Oof. Hey, what's your problem?
LANA: My problem is I don't want a thousand of steel balls to shred my genitals.
CYRIL: Huh?
ARCHER: Claymore mine. Full of steel balls that fly a thousand meters - or one click - a second, right at dick level.
CYRIL: Jeezy petes...
LANA: Or a  level, which in your case would also take off your head. So quit reading and pay attention.
CYRIL: But there's a lot of useful stuff in here, organizational charts, inventory and cash-flow analyses... spreadsheets?
ARCHER: Of what, po ible outcomes with a twenty-sided die?
CYRIL: Well you don't need a spreadsheet for that...
ARCHER: Yeah and you don't need one to know you're gonna suck at being a field agent Cyril. So why do you wanna be one?
CYRIL: I dunno, I just wanna feel like I'm a part of the team, ya know? I gue  I wanna... feel like I matter more.
ARCHER: Wow, not afraid to dump out your purse in the jungle, huh? Okay Cyril, then le on One-A. In a potentially hostile environment, like this, the key is total situational awarene .
CYRIL: Okay...
ARCHER: You look, you listen, you smell. And you remember to check your six.
CYRIL: My six what. Is that my gun? The old six shooter.
ARCHER: Oh my God, a clock Cyril, It means behind you. Because the last thing you want is -- Uh Lana, hold up a sec?
LANA: Archer we don't have a -- Cyril?
ARCHER: Yeah, that's why I said hold up.
LANA: Archer!
ARCHER: Don't yell at me, I looked away for literally literally one second! LANA: Well where the hell did he go? !
ARCHER: I dunno, it's like... he just...
LANA: You're looking for Predator, aren't you?
ARCHER: Yes.
LANA: Couple things. A, he's invisible -
ARCHER: Not totally, he has a telltale shimmer. Ow!
LANA: And B, lower your frickin voice.
MAN: iOye! ! Manos arriba!
ARCHER: Is that Cyril?
MAN: ¿iQuien es? !
ARCHER: No, it's not whimpery enough. LANA: Cyril! Cyril! God damn it.
ARCHER: Well, look on the bright side.
LANA: Which is?
ARCHER: Which is what? LANA: What's the bright side? !
ARCHER: Oh. That's a figure of speech.
ARCHER: All I'm saying is there are a million green rectangularly reasons to complete the mi ion, and zero reasons not to.
LANA: You mean besides Cyril getting captured.
ARCHER: Yeah! Besides that. And if Calzado's men got Cyril, we'll rescue him when we get Calzado.
Problemo solvedo LANA: What if it was F.A.R.K. or V.E.L.N.
ARCHER: Then we'll use some of the million dallar reward to pay his ransom. So shut up, Cyril's going to be fine. Unle  a tiger ate him.
LANA: Tigers don't live in South America.
ARCHER: Well at least one does because I just heard its spine-tingling roar.
LANA: That was a jaguar, dumba .
ARCHER: Thanks, Marlon Perkins. I think I know a tiger when I hear one.
LANA: Every time, your big fat mouth get's us caught, every time.
ARCHER: Not every time, like a third of the time. And a thousand bucks that's a tiger Lana.
CHERYL/CAROL: If this doesn't work we just paid a hundred bucks for liquid fart.
PAM: Yeah, well here's shit in your eye.
GILLETTE: Oh god, it tastes worse than it smells. PAM: Man, if I had a nickel for every time I heard a guy said that, I'd have eight nickels.
LANA: Archer, I swear to God if you don't shut up.
ARCHER: I'm just saying if it comes down to that, and I hope it doesn't, there's no sense in us both getting raped.
CALZADO: Fernando, our special guests must not be injured in any way.
ARCHER: Uh, does that include rape related injuries?
CALZADO: Of course. No one is going to rape you. What is wrong with you?
LANA: We're scared. We're just tourists, see, and our car broke down.
CALZADO: So the a ault weapons and plastic explosives, why do you have these?
ARCHER: O.K. yes, let me explain. Busted, we're arms dealers.
CALZADO: No, I think not. I Think you are hunting Román Calzado. In the hopes of a million dollar reward.
ARCHER: O.K. yes, busted again. but I think now we're kinda rethinking that.
CALZADO: So, if I give you two million, will you go away and say you never found me?
LANA: I -- Oh my God, totally yes.
ARCHER: Then we give mother a million and you and I can split the other million. Calzado, you've got yourself a deal.
CALZADO: Excellent. But of course I was joking. Obviously I can not allow you to live.
ARCHER: No, yes you can.
CALZADO: Or choose not to, whatever, besides, throwing money away like that would not please el contador.
LANA: El contador, doesn't that mean.
CYRIL: The accountant, si.
ARCHER: Cyril? !
CALZADO: Que?
LANA: No he said cereal.
CALZADO: Que? CYRIL: Cerealas. El quiere desayuno.
CALZADO: And people in hell want ice water. Oye.
CYRIL: Pardon.
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh my God! I'm gonna die in a toilet stall just like the gypsy said.
PAM: Damn that Krieger. Nazi-clone-bastard.
GILLETTE: Well, we don't know it was the tea.
PAM: Aagh! Who the hell are you? !
GILLETTE: I'm your friend, Pam, I'm -- Pam? !
PAM: You're not my friend, you're a Decepticon CHERYL/CAROL: Waaaagh! How are you both still alive? ! The floor is lava! The floor is lava!
KRIEGER: Clinical trial thirteen. Subjects' responses are exceeding expectations.
GILLETTE: Pam you're melting! You're melting!
CHERYL/CAROL: Because the floor is lah-vuh-huhhhh!
PAM: Must! Kill! Decepticon!
KRIEGER: Oh, which reminds me: call Terry. RROWWR!
ARCHER: The tiger says... RROWWR!
ARCHER: The tiger also says you owe me a thousand dollars, so -
LANA: No! I don't! Because I didn't bet!
ARCHER: The welsher says...
CYRIL: P  t!
ARCHER: No, that's a snake. CYRIL: Oh boy, am I glad to see you guys!
LANA: Cyril, what the hell's going on? !
ARCHER: Are you a drug dealer now, or...?
CYRIL: What? No! And you guys aren't gonna believe what happened! I had, um, gastric distre , or whatever, so I was just gonna duck off the trail...
ARCHER: And you remember to check your six.
CYRIL: My six what?
CYRIL: Before I knew what was happening... Oh man, right in my new pants!
HENCHMAN: iOye!
CYRIL: Hellooo...
HENCHMAN: ! Manos arriba! ¿! Quien es? !
CYRIL: And I only had a second to answer, so I thought, what would Lana do?
ARCHER: Not Archer?
CYRIL: No, I had to outsmart them. ARCHER: He said, suddenly too big for his shit-caked britches.
LANA: Archer.
CYRIL: And then it came to me! Uh... quien soy? Soy el contador! Enviado de La Sombra! Donde está Calzado? !
ARCHER: What's a La Sombra?
CYRIL: Calzado's bo , don't you remember the do ier?
ARCHER: No. LANA: Yes. But, what about the gunshot?
CYRIL: Then they brought me here, and I bluffed my way through the rest...
CALZADO: La Sombra did not say you were coming.
CYRIL: Well, I a ume he did not want to give you the time to cook your books.
CALZADO: I -- that -- I swear I don't do that! CYRIL: Well, then you are a fool.
CALZADO: ¿Que?
CYRIL: You pay La Sombra sixty-four cents on every dollar you make, no?
CALZADO: Mmmmas o menos, pero... CYRIL: I can get that down to thirty cents, and he will never even know.
CALZADO: Sí? ! Pero como? !
CYRIL: You just leave that to me, amigo.
CALZADO: Wait, what's in this for you? CYRIL: We split the difference, of course! But first I need some clean clothes. This is not mud all over my pants. It's caca.
LANA: Holy shit, Cyril!
ARCHER: Literally.
CYRIL: Yeah, really kinda wish I'd skipped the diarrhea part...
LANA: Forget that, you did great! CYRIL: Really?
ARCHER: It figuratively kills me to say this Cyril, but yeah, you did.
LANA: So now what, what's the plan?
CYRIL: Oh. Well, I was hoping you guys could come up with something. And ideally before tomorrow at dawn.
ARCHER: Why, what's --
CALZADO: What is going on here? !
CYRIL: Ah, amigo! I was just mocking this giant negre  and her si y sidekick.
CALZADO: Yes, they are ridiculous, no? Are the accommodations to your liking?
ARCHER: Honestly?
LANA: No. You shouldn't even keep animals in these conditions. Look at them. Cement floors, steel bars, no room to run around, nothing to play with...
CALZADO: Ah, I think perhaps you are confusing this with a zoo.
ARCHER: I think, maybe, it's all these exotic animals.
CALZADO: Yes, exotic animals for me to hunt. LANA: You hunt them? ! How can you do that? !
CALZADO: Like this.
ARCHER: God damn dude.
CALZADO: But you see? Even the majestic Bengal tiger is too easy to kill! It's boring! Which is why tomorrow at dawn, I will be hunting the most dangerous game in the world!
ARCHER: Jai alai?
LANA: Us!
ARCHER: What? !
CALZADO: Sí. So sleep well, amigos! I want you rested and strong for tomorrow! Venga, Señor Contador, cenamos juntos!
CYRIL: So yeah, try to think of a plan!
LANA: Well, go ahead and say it.
ARCHER: Say what. LANA: How since we're gonna die in the morning we should have sex now.
ARCHER: After seeing a tiger get murdered, Lana? No offense, but I'm not really in the mood. If you want, I can watch while you masturbate. But I can tell you right now my heart's not gonna be in it. It will be with that tiger's family. But, go ahead, start.
CALZADO: And so begins the hunt for the most dangerous game!
CYRIL: Hooray...
LANA: So what are the rules here, exactly?
ARCHER: Lana be still.
CALZADO: You get a thirty-minute head start. Then El Contador and I, just us, alone, will track you and kill you.
CYRIL: Uh, uh... oh! Can they split up?
CALZADO: Ehhh, sure, why not.
CYRIL: Then I propose a friendly wager. We each hunt one of them, and the first to kill his quarry is the winner.
CALZADO: I like this idea. But which --
CYRIL: I get the woman called it boom!
CALZADO: I -- all right, since you called it. iOye! Cochino... Okay, let's hunt some humans!
LANA: Go go go go gunngh! Are you really that selfish? !
ARCHER: Apparently!
KRIEGER: Clinical trial thirteen, update. As hypothesized, after mind-shredding hallucinations, subjects B and C have lapsed into deep unconsciousne ... Subject A, however, remains at large. Begin clinical trial fourteen...
CYRIL: Lana? Lana. Where the heck is - shmmpf!
LANA: Don't scream, it's me.
CYRIL: Oh thank God, I thought those were yeti hands...
LANA: Never gets old. But good idea back there, getting everybody to split up.
CYRIL: Thanks, yeah, I figured you'd know to head back to the, uh, LZ thingy --
LANA: Which we've only got about an hour to get to so --
CYRIL: -- and I figured once I found you we could work together to rescue Archer, capture Calzado, and escape.
LANA: Ya know, you don't actually suck at this.
CYRIL: Really?
LANA: You're thinking tactically, making quick decisions... and I gotta tell ya, confidence is pretty damn sexy.
CYRIL: Reeally...
LANA: Theoretically.
CYRIL: Sorry. LANA: Okay, you're doing pretty well so far, so what's the plan, rookie? And sooner would be better than later.
CYRIL: Yeah, Calzado's on a darn threewheeler. Can you believe that guy?
LANA: Who, the drug-lord who hunts humans for sport?
CYRIL: I know, but that's just lame.
LANA: Cyril? CYRIL: Uh, uh, okay, so we have to a ume Archer's heading back to the LZ too, but he can't po ibly outrun Calzado...
LANA: Yeah, neither can we, so...?
CYRIL: We don't need to outrun him! Just Archer!
LANA: What?
CYRIL: Come on!
ARCHER: Oww! Oh eat a dick, jungle! Cover it with malaria and leeches, sprinkle some dengue fever on it, and eat a big goddamn jungly dick! Yeah, you do that, and I'll just wait here for a bask of Orinoco crocodiles to wander by and eat me. Oh great, that's probably them now, tearing around on specially-equipped croc-choppers. Wait, what the...? Godde  of the Jungle, I take it all back! For when I was thirsty, you saw fit to slake my thiiiiiirrrrst! Godde  of the Jungle, you are a whore. Oh thank God, I thought you were crocodiles.
CALZADO: Crocodiles? On a three-wheeler?
ARCHER: Right? How scary would that be?
CALZADO: Mmm, probably not as scary as knowing that I am going to cut you down from there, and then gut you like a fish.
ARCHER: Well then you're obviously an idiot when it comes to crocodiles, AKA the world's most deadliest predators.
CALZADO: I am the world's deadliest predator!
CYRIL: Or are you?
CALZADO: ¿Que? ARCHER: Cyril? !
CALZADO: No breakfast for you!
CYRIL: No, that's my name, Calzado. Cyril Figgis... ISIS agent.
CALZADO: Bastardo mentiroso! ISIS? !
CYRIL: That's right. And you're under arrest. Albeit extra-judicially.
CALZADO: Over my dead body!
CYRIL: Well, that can be arranged. Lana?
LANA: Hellooo...
CALZADO: Ay, caramba...
ARCHER: Wh-? Wait a minute, was I just bait? !
CYRIL: That's right, Archer. All part of my brilliant plan. Lana, get some vines and tie him up, chop-chop.
LANA: Chop-chop?
ARCHER: Here we go...
CYRIL: Uh yeah, it means hurry? C'mon, we got a chopper to catch, tie him up!
LANA: You do it.
CYRIL: Okay, I see what you're doing here. Hands behind your back, Calzado.
CALZADO: Make me.
CYRIL: I -- look, she will shoot you!
LANA: No I won't.
ARCHER: No she won't! C'mon Cyril, go all rogue on him!
CYRIL: Guys c'mon, this is ridicul -- ungh! I think I'm gonna be -- ungh! Yeah, I'm gonna be sick...
ARCHER: Here, maybe this'll help...
CYRIL: Aaagh! My eyes!
ARCHER: Probably shouldn't have done that. Not enough left to get drunk on.
CALZADO: Bastardo! I kill you!
CYRIL: Lanaaaa!
CALZADO: What the hell damn guy.
CYRIL: Oh thank you thank you thank you...
LANA: You're welcome, Cyril. So, did you learn any valuable le ons today?
CYRIL: Yes, I did.
ARCHER: Me too. I learned I don't like being bait.
CYRIL: Owww!
ARCHER: Sorry, Cyril, did that hurt? Cyril. Cyril. Cyriiillll!
CYRIL: Yes it frickin hurt!
ARCHER: Yeah, right?
MALORY: What? ! Yes, obviously I heard what you said! I just can't believe the head of the DEA has the balls to say it! Oh, is that a fact! Oh it is. M-hm. Yep.
ARCHER: So, uh... How'd that go?
MALORY: Oh, fine. He was just explaining to me why ISIS won't be receiving any reward for capturing Calzado.
EVERYBODY: [ What ? !] Because apparently there's no proof that we did.
LANA: We literally handed Calzado to them!
MALORY: And in return, did they hand you a signed receipt for the prisoner?
ARCHER: No, they -- oh.
LANA: Oh, shit.
MALORY: Mm. So, well done. Because that's exactly the brand of unparalleled profe ional excellence that I've come to expect at ISIS.
PAM: No no no no nooo!
ARCHER: What the --
CYRIL: Oh, I wish I was still blind.
PAM: You'll never take me aliiiive!
MALORY: What was I saying? Oh yes, unparalleled...
KRIEGER: Paaaam! For the love of God, seal the exits!
MALORY: Profe ional...
CHERYL/CAROL: That's our pee, and that's the last I better hear about it. Because this stupid building is a tinderbox, and I will burn it to the ground.
MALORY: Excellence.
ARCHER: Oh hey, speaking of excellent, did you hear we met a tiger? ! But he got murdered.
