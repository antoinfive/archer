(Archer moaning deliriously)
>> LANA: Archer.
>> ARCHER: Lana? (Lana yelps) Lana!
>> LANA: Whoa, Jesus Christ! Chill out, Miggs!
>> ARCHER: I'm sorry, it's just been so long.
>> LANA: Okay, it's been...
>> ARCHER: Oh, my God. You're pregnant again?!
>> LANA: What?
>> ARCHER: How long have I been down here, left to rot in this godforsaken hole?!
>> LANA: Like... three weeks.
>> ARCHER: Hmm, seems so much longer than that.
>> LANA: It...
>> ARCHER: So, please tell me that's an entire canard à la  pre e with a file in it.
>> LANA: Half a chicken, no file, just that weird quasi-cornbread they have here.
>> ARCHER: Ugh, why do you even bother?
>> LANA: That's weird, I was asking myself the same thing on the way down here.
>> ARCHER: And then brought crappy food anyway?
>> LANA: And then left?
>> ARCHER: No, no, no, wait, come on, Lana, I-I'm sorry, but I-I'm starting to lose it down here. You-you got to make him let me go!
>> LANA: Make him how?
>> ARCHER: Well, I hate to even ask, but...
>> LANA: Blow him?
>> ARCHER: Your words.
>> LANA: And then what, Archer, you want me to blow the whole army?
>> ARCHER: How is there still an army? How have the rebels not wiped them out already?
>> LANA: Because turns out, he's actually very good at commanding an army.
>> CYRIL: And as Third and Fourth Battalion withdraw, here comes First Armored, and now the rebels are outflanked. >> COMANDANTE (laughs): Sir, it's brilliant!
>> CYRIL: A cla ic pincher movement. Just like Hannibal at the battle of Cannae. And also Keith, in my Warhammer guild.
>> LANA: So, get used to that weird cornbread, 'cause you might be down here a...
>> ARCHER: Lana, I need a woman's touch! (Lana grunts) Oh! Ow! I'm sorry, Lana. I said a woman, not a stevedore who lost his hand in a stevedoring accident and then got a hand transplant from an actual bear.
>> LANA: So, did you want to just do it right through the bars or...?
>> ARCHER: I mean, we do. And sometimes they do.
>> CALDÉRON: Hello.
>> LANA: I... wait. So, in three weeks, you go from you're gonna execute Archer to now you guys are, like, swinger pals?
>> CALDÉRON: Well, I wouldn't say "pals."
>> ARCHER: Wow, not what you said yesterday.
>> CALDÉRON: Oh, come on, that was the pruno talking.
>> LANA: Well, I hate to break up this delightful ménage, but Presidente Cyril wants her back upstairs.
>> ARCHER: Wait, what?
>> CALDÉRON: What?
>> JULIANA: Why.
>> LANA: Gue .
>> JULIANA: Ah. >> LANA: Mm.
>> CALDÉRON: Ow! Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
>> BOTH: What?
>> CALDÉRON: Archer, do you want me to move over one?
>> ARCHER: Eh.
>> CYRIL: Ah, Madame First Lady. So good of you to join me.
>> JULIANA: It's not as if I had a choice.
>> CYRIL: Well...
>> JULIANA: Nor am I still the the first lady.
>> CYRIL: Well, maybe not technically, since your husband divorced you and then was immediately deposed by me, but the situation is, as they say, fluid.
>> LANA: Ugh. I brought her, can I go now?
>> CYRIL: Yes, for the love of God, get out.
>> LANA: I meant home. >> PAM (laughing): What are you, nuts? Cap'n Crunch here just took all the coca fields back from the rebels. We're sitting on an endle supply.
>> LANA: Of what, coca leaf smoothies? (rhythmic gulping) Oh, my God. That's a coca leaf smoothie.
>> CHERLENE: And they're gro . It basically tastes like a fart of itself, but it's better than the cocaine donuts and whipped cocaine she was eating. (Pam burps)
>> PAM: 'Cause that's just empty calories.
>> LANA: Well, and cocaine.
>> PAM: Which, if I'm being totally honest, I maybe might have a problem with.
>> LANA: No.
>> CYRIL: And, Lana, the rebels still control the airport. It's their HQ. So, unle  you want to walk, you can't go home.
>> MALORY: And why on Earth would you want to? (Lana sighs)
>> CYRIL: Uh...
>> MALORY: Why bother going back? The U.S. government stole your livelihood, forced you to become a criminal. And I hate to say it, but it's not like you have a man waiting for you.
>> LANA: I... You know...
>> MALORY: Whereas here we have everything we need. It's like San Marcos has been waiting thousands of years for us to arrive. Lana, this could be our...
>> LANA: Don't.
>> MALORY: Zion, yes, there, I said it. (Pam burps)
>> PAM: Wait, they got weed here, too?
>> LANA: That's not what the song's about!
>> CHERLENE: Told you.
>> LANA: But I just this second realized why you want to stay down here. Cyril's just the Vader to your Palpatine.
>> MALORY: Is that a reference I should get, or...?
>> LANA: Seriously?
>> MALORY: Well, I'm sorry, Lana, I didn't go to rabbinical school.
>> LANA: It's from... No, you know what? Never mind. But, spoiler alert, Vader ends up killing Palpatine.
>> CYRIL: Hey.
>> CHERLENE: But only for three days, right? And then he moves the rock and comes out of his cave stronger than ever.
>> PAM: Then he shuts off the tractor beam, releasing the Jews from captivity.
>> LANA: What?
>> CYRIL: Hey.
>> MALORY: Wait, yes, now that sounds familiar.
>> LANA: It cannot po ibly.
>> MALORY: Gospel of Luke?
>> CYRIL: Hey.
>> LANA: Oh for... Ray, you used to be a preacher, you want to back me up here?
>> RAY: I actually don't know. My church didn't really do the New Testament.
>> LANA: The one with Jesus Christ in it.
>> RAY: I mean, I take your word for it, but...
>> CYRIL: Hey! Will you idiots get out?! I'm trying to talk to the first lady!
>> CHERLENE: Of what, this country or country music? 'Cause I'm first lady of both! CYRIL No, you're not...
>> CHERLENE: Outlaw country! (jail door bangs shut) (Cherlene sighs)
>> CALDÉRON: Oh, my God, my beautiful and also multi-talented wife! You are here!
>> CHERLENE: I know, right? It's like, finally.
>> ARCHER: As in... this is a good thing? (plays random notes)
>> CHERLENE: Duh! I'm finally gonna get the outlaw country cred I deserve.
>> CALDÉRON: Oh, my God, you've always deserved it.
>> ARCHER: Wait, how does being in jail...?
>> CHERLENE: Paging Dr. Black, Dr. Man In Black! Johnny Cash was in Folsom Prison and San Quentin, so...
>> ARCHER: Yeah, to visit.
>> CHERLENE: Hmm?
>> ARCHER: He just played for the prisoners, dummy. He wasn't actually in prison. (plays "womp womp") But don't worry. We're gonna get out of here and go join the rebels.
>> CALDÉRON: Yes, then you and I, my beautiful wife, will live a simple life in the hills, scratching shit food, like yams, out of the ground with a, uh, yam-scratcher.
>> CHERLENE: Okay, A-- start counting backwards from a million years, and when you get to zero that still won't happen.
>> CALDÉRON: Aw.
>> CHERLENE: And B-- how... how do we get out of here?
>> ARCHER: Well, we're, uh, still fine-tuning it, but...
>> CALDÉRON: We have no plan, whatsoever.
>> CHERLENE: Okay, good, because I didn't want to step on anybody's toes, but byoink.
>> CALDÉRON: Whaaaaat?
>> ARCHER: Where did you get that?
>> CHERLENE: Let's just say, "I honestly don't know."
>> ARCHER: Fair enough.
>> CHERLENE: Cyril says the rebel headquarters are... Wait, is it "are" or is it "is"?
>> ARCHER: It's "where," idiot!
>> CHERLENE: The airport! Jesus!
>> CALDÉRON: And you, sir, will keep a civil tongue in your head when you are addre ing the First Lady of the government-in-exile of La República de San Marcos!
>> CHERLENE: And also country music.
>> ARCHER: I facetiously beg milady's pardon.
>> CHERLENE: Oh, milady facetiously grants it.
>> ARCHER: Oh, goody. Now let's steal a car, go join the rebels, then come back here and crush Cyril's stupid army.
>> CALDÉRON: You make it sound so easy. >> ARCHER (chuckling): Well, it's Cyril. I mean, unle  he's got a nuclear warhead in his pants...
>> CHERLENE: Which he totally does.
>> KRIEGER: Which, guys, can we talk about this? >> KRIEGER CLONE 1: The time for talk is kaput, Klon-Bruder. Now is the time for action! >> KRIEGER CLONE 2: Clone bone!
>> CHERLENE: And by that I mean his... you know...
>> ARCHER: Yeah, we...
>> CHERLENE: Let me finish! ...penis. No, you ruined it. And by "it," I meant the moment. Not his penis.
>> ARCHER: I...
>> CHERLENE: Penis.
>> ARCHER: Will you shut up?! I know what I'm doing!
>> CALDÉRON: Yes, but don't do what you are doing! (Caldéron and Cherlene yelp) (Archer chuckles)
>> CALDÉRON: Are you crazy?! This car is worth one quarter of $1 million!
>> CHERLENE: Well, was.
>> ARCHER: And did you ever think maybe your fleet of pricele  cars is the reason you're fighting off a rebellion?
>> CALDÉRON: I'm fighting the rebels because that is what we do! My father fought the rebels, his father fought the rebels...
>> CHERLENE: So, like a family busine .
>> ARCHER: That manufactures oppre ion.
>> CALDÉRON: Well, and cocaine. In fact...
>> CHERLENE: Stop! (Archer and Caldéron scream) (tires screeching)
>> ARCHER: What?!
>> CHERLENE: That. (Archer gasps) I mean, if you think we have time. (tiger roars)
>> ARCHER: I... Is there a tiger?
>> CALDÉRON: Of course there is a tiger. Where did you think you are, Tegucigalpa? (Archer giggles gleefully) (tires squealing)
>> CYRIL: And so, by the power self-vested in me, I now pronounce us man and wife, and I may also ki  the bride. (Cyril ki ing, Juliana grunts)
>> PAM: Yay!
>> MALORY: Ugh, second worst wedding ever.
>> RAY: Yeah, but at least nobody died. >> PAM (laughing): Yet! (clears throat) Inappropes.
>> MALORY: What is wrong with you?
>> PAM: I'm trying to make that a thing people say, like, "Damn, dawg, that's inappropes!" Plus, I think I'm addicted to cocaine.
>> MALORY: Well, but look on the bright side. With any luck at all, it will save me the trouble of killing you myself. >> PAM (sniffling): Damn, dawg...
>> RAY: Inappropes.
>> PAM: Yay! >> ARCHER (quietly): Yay! Yay! (tiger roars) They should've sent a poet. Oh, and some meat. Do we have any meat? (elephant trumpets)
>> CALDÉRON: Literally tons.
>> ARCHER: No, I didn't mean another animal. I meant like a steak, or some...
>> CALDÉRON: Typical American. You think meat comes from the  supermercado, all wrapped in a nice plastic wrap.
>> ARCHER: Yeah, you're describing meat.
>> CALDÉRON: No, no, no. Meat is blood and bones and sinew!
>> ARCHER: Well, now you're describing not-meat.
>> CALDÉRON: Meat is whatever the tiger says is meat, because God made him the bo  and all the other animals his food! (tiger roars)
>> ARCHER: Hang on, buddy. And thank you, George Bore-well, for that clunky analogy in defense of totalitarianism, but I'm not feeding Shane an elephant.
>> CHERLENE: Who the hell is... (gasps) Oh, my God, he's totally a Shane. So let me bounce this off you guys...
>> KRIEGER: What say we don't launch this giant nerve gas mi ile at, uh... where did you say you were launching it? >> KRIEGER CLONE 1: Wouldn't you like to know? (hearty laughter)
>> KRIEGER: I would, actually. Come on, you guys are acting a little... insane. >> KRIEGER CLONE 1: Do you know what's insane?!
>> KRIEGER: Yeah, this. All of it, everything. The rocket, uh... I'm not really comfortable with the clone-bone. >> KRIEGER CLONE 1: You're not doing it right. Now move, so I can begin the launch sequence.
>> KRIEGER: Over my dead... ...body, man that was a jinx, huh? (cocks gun) No, no, no, wait, wait, wait!
>> ARCHER: Hang on! As amazing as it would be, we can't take Shane with us.
>> CHERLENE: Yeah, we can, watch.
>> BOTH: No, no, no, no! No, don't! (low rumbling growl)
>> CALDÉRON: Okay, okay, okay, okay.
>> ARCHER: Carol, listen to me very closely.
>> CHERLENE: Why, you gonna walk me through your organic method of vaginal hygiene?
>> ARCHER: My what?
>> CHERLENE: You're a bigger pu y than Shane! Come here, boy! (smacking lips) (tiger roars, Caldéron screams)
>> ARCHER AND CHERLENE: Shane! (Caldéron screams)
>> CHERLENE: Do something! (Caldéron screaming)
>> ARCHER: Like what? >> KRIEGER CLONE 1: Get him! (grunting) >> KRIEGER CLONE 2: We're coming, brother! >> KRIEGER CLONE 3: Hiy...! (gunshot) (Krieger Clone 3 screams) >> KRIEGER CLONE 2: No...! >> KRIEGER CLONE 1: Brother...! (thuds) You bastard! Brother, the launch sequence!
>> KRIEGER: No! (keyboard clicking) (strained grunting) (gunshot) >> KRIEGER CLONE 1: Don't stop! (four gunshots) (grunting) >> KRIEGER CLONE 2: Almost... there.
>> KRIEGER: Oh, come on! >> KRIEGER CLONE 2: Shut... up.
>>> SEXY ROBOT VOICE: Launch sequence initiated.
>> KRIEGER: No! >> KRIEGER CLONE 1 (sobs): No! (thuds) (strained grunting) (choking)
>> KRIEGER: Ha-ha! It doesn't work with a bow... tiiiiiiiiieeeeee! (loud thuds)
>> ARCHER: Shane! Shane...!
>> CHERLENE: Shane...! (Caldéron screaming) (tiger roars) (scream stops abruptly)
>> ARCHER: Shane? (tiger snuffles) (low, contented growl)
>> CHERLENE: Well, we should've gue ed that was gonna happen. (chuckling)
>> ARCHER: W... we should've?
>> CHERLENE: Well, or at least could've. I mean...
>> ARCHER: Yeah, I-I-I gue , uh... I gue  a leopard can't change his spots.
>> CHERLENE: Uh... I don't know that much about leopards.
>> ARCHER: That was actually a proverb.
>> CHERLENE: That was actually a tiger.
>> SEXY ROBOT VOICE: Minutes to
launch: 180.
>> KRIEGER: Huh. That is a lot longer than I thought it would be.
>> ARCHER: Okay, when we get to rebel HQ, they might be aggre ive at first, but...
>> CHERLENE: They wouldn't if we had a damn tiger. (Archer sighs)
>> ARCHER: No. We're-we're not going back. Unle ... No.
>> CHERLENE: What if...
>> ARCHER: He had his chance!
>> JULIANA: A what? >> CYRIL: A charivari. Also called a shivaree? You know, it's that thing where everybody bangs pots and pans outside our room as we... consummate. (chuckles)
>> JULIANA: Oh... n-no. We're not doing that.
>> LANA: Ha-ha! Ow! Ray, my feet are already killing me.
>> RAY: Sorry.
>> MALORY: He's probably not used to leading.
>> RAY: You know...
>> MALORY: You, on the other hand... lead away.
>> PAM: Mind if I cut in?
>> COMANDANTE: No.
>> MALORY: Yes!
>> PAM: Screw you guys. Hey, Krieger!
>> KRIEGER: What the hell is going on?
>> PAM: Cyril's the new dictator...
>> CYRIL: President.
>> PAM: Shut up, and he just married crazy tits, and I need a dance partner.
>> KRIEGER: Wh...? So nobody noticed that I've been mi ing for three weeks?
>> RAY: Um...
>> CYRIL: No.
>> MALORY: Well, I certainly didn't.
>> PAM: We figured the vampires ate you.
>> MALORY: The what?
>> LANA: Wait, what? >> KRIEGER (sighs): They're not vampires, they're my clones. Or I'm their clone, or...
>> MALORY: Oh, please, you and your clone nonsense, it's all a bunch of...
>> LANA: Holy shit.
>> CYRIL: Why was I not informed of this, Krieger?
>> PAM: If he even is Krieger!
>> CYRIL: Huh?
>> RAY: What?
>> PAM: The real Krieger could be down there!
>> KRIEGER: Oh, for... that is just... I won't even dignify that with a response. Uh, uh... (snapping fingers)
>> LANA: Pam?
>> KRIEGER: Pam!
>> PAM: Uh-huh.
>> KRIEGER: I've got a concu ion. And this regular tie means nothing, I don't like bow ties so I switched.
>> LANA: Well, you certainly sound concu ed.
>> PAM: He sounds like a vampire! I say we tie him up and let the sun sort it out!
>> LANA: You need to hush.
>> SEXY ROBOT VOICE: Minutes to
launch: 150.
>> MALORY: What is that?
>> PAM: What is going on?
>> CYRIL: Tell me that robot's not talking about launching this rocket, Krieger.
>> PAM: Or should we say Count Krieg... Ow! Ow! Ow, cut it out! Ow! Goddamn it! Ow!
>> LANA: Thank you.
>> PAM: Vampire lovers.
>> KRIEGER: Yeah, so, here's the thing...
>> ARCHER: This is it, rebel headquarters. Now, remember, let me do the talking.
>> CHERLENE: Got it.
>> ARCHER: I'm serious.
>> CHERLENE: I got it. >> ARCHER: Look at me.
>> CHERLENE: I got it! Jesus!
>> ARCHER: Okay. Then here we go. (rebels shouting in Spanish)
>> REBEL SOLDIER: Pinche cabrón!
>> CHERLENE: Ow!
>> ARCHER: Goddamn it! You said you'd let me do the... (grunts) (Cherlene laughing) >> REBEL SOLDIER 2: ¡Espere,  espere!  ¡Mira, mira!  Es la cantante!
>> CHERLENE: * It's all about me this time... * Aw...
>> MALORY: So. You're saying this gigantic rocket is not only full of deadly nerve gas, but also aimed God knows where?
>> KRIEGER: Well, that statement presupposes the existence of God, but...
>> MALORY: Krieger, I am about two seconds away from telling Pam to get a wooden stake.
>> PAM: Yay!
>> KRIEGER: I'm not a vampire!
>> MALORY: Doesn't matter to the stake.
>> KRIEGER: Then yes! It's full of nerve gas, and I don't know where it's aimed!
>> LANA: What? What's the range on this thing?
>> KRIEGER: I don't know, 2,000 miles? (Malory gasps)
>> MALORY: How far away is the Upper East Side?
>> KRIEGER: I don't know, 1,980-something miles? (Malory screams)
>> CYRIL: Okay, this is a presidential order from the president. Shut it down!
>> KRIEGER: I can't!
>> PAM: Can't, or won't?
>> KRIEGER: Can't! >> PAM: Oh. I didn't hear you.
>> LANA: Ray, can you override the launch sequence?
>> RAY: Um...
>> SEXY ROBOT VOICE: Launch sequence accelerated.
>> RAY: No. (all exclaiming)
>> MALORY: Oh, for God's sake.
>> SEXY ROBOT VOICE: Minutes to
launch: 90.
>> LANA: Cyril...
>> CYRIL: Uh, it's actually Señor Presidente, but...
>> LANA: Shh, hush. Now I know you've had a fun time as dictator, and we all enjoyed this little break from him, but Cyril-- and if you tell him I said this, I'll break your frickin' arms-- it's... ugh... Archer time.
>> CYRIL: Wha...? Oh, all right.
>> LANA: Krieger, I a ume the whatever...
>> PAM: Doppelkriegers.
>> LANA: I a ume they had a lab, so take Ray and see if you can find some info on how to shut this damn thing down. We'll go get Archer.
>> PAM: Ooh, and Cherlene!
>> LANA: Ooh, and no. Because she isn't here.
>> CYRIL: Oh! Damn it, Archer! Damn you! You can't even let me pretend to be magnanimous while inwardly gloating!
>> MALORY: Oh, shut up. What does the note say? >> LANA (reading): So, airport?
>> PAM: But the note says not... (mumbling)
>> CYRIL: Well, I gue  that settles that! I mean, it's not like we can just waltz into enemy territory and... Well, I certainly can't.
>> LANA: Can't, or...
>> CYRIL: Both, either, all. They'd shoot me on sight, Lana. And if you want Archer so damn bad, you can go get him your... (tires squealing) Huh. I didn't think she'd actually do it.
>> MALORY: Then you're an idiot.
>> CYRIL: Oh, I'm the idiot?
>> MALORY: Yes. (Archer grunts)
>> ARCHER: What the...? Holly?
>> HOLLY: Archer?
>> SLATER: Rando?
>> ARCHER: Slater? >> HOLLY: Who the hell is Rando?
>> SLATER: Him!
>> HOLLY: That's Sterling Archer! >> CHERLENE (loudly): A-hem! And I am Cherlene? The Queen of Outlaw Country?
>> SLATER: What the hell are you doing here?
>> ARCHER: What the hell are you doing here?
>> HOLLY: I could ask you the same question. I am asking you the same question!
>> ARCHER: We came to join the rebels.
>> SLATER: What?
>> ARCHER: What's the FBI doing in San Marcos? With a cocaine smuggler? (Holly sighs)
>> HOLLY: I'm not FBI, and he's not a...
>> SLATER: Well, technically, I am, but...
>> HOLLY: We're both CIA.
>> ARCHER: What?! >> CHERLENE (whispering): C... I... A.
>> SLATER: And we're also the rebels.
>> HOLLY: And you are in a mundo of caca.
>> LANA: Okay! Listen, stop, listen to me!
>> ARCHER: Lana?!
>> LANA: Holly? What's the FBI doing...
>> ARCHER: These dickheads aren't FBI, Lana, they're CIA! And also the rebels! Huh. Thought that would get more of a reaction.
>> LANA: Yeah, no, that is, um... news, uh... but my water just broke, so... Captioned by  Media Acce  Group at WGBH  acce .wgbh.org
