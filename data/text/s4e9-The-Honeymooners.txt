LANA: What do you think you're doing ?
ARCHER: My job, Lana.
LANA: And what part of your job, exactly, is groping my a ?
ARCHER: The part that calls for spycraft. C'mon, we're posing as newlyweds --
LANA: Yeah, posing.
ARCHER: -- and I am drunk on nuptial bli .
LANA: You're drunk on champagne.
ARCHER: Little column A, little column B. LANA: Mrvit!
ARCHER: Fine, but when you take my hand off your lately almost overly ample butt --
LANA: Odd choice of dying words...
ARCHER: I don't just question your commitment to the mi ion, Lana, I question your commitment to America.
LANA: Instead of feeling me up in the lobby --
ARCHER: Wait til we're in the room, got it.
LANA: -- what say we focus on the mi ion: catching the North Koreans who are in New York to buy enriched uranium.
ARCHER: Can't we do both?
LANA: Can't you shut up?
ARCHER: Can't you put a price tag on freedom? I mean you can't put a price tag on freedom. Always never forget that.
DESK CLERK: Here's your key for the honeymoon suite, congratties, and if I could just get a credit card for the room and any incidentals, we'll be --
LANA: Broke, Jesus, the room's that much?!
DESK CLERK: Is there a problem?
LANA: Not if we're buying it as a condo.
DESK CLERK: I may have something a bit more in your price range... basement okay?
ARCHER: No it's not, because as love-besotted newlyweds we want the honeymoon suite. And price range is...rangele .
LANA: Archer...?!
ARCHER: Shhh, a few minutes more, darling, and you can have your way with me.
LANA: Ugh, I wish...
ARCHER: I know. Soon.
DESK CLERK: Alrighty, and we are just all set. Enjoy your stay.
ARCHER: Enjoy your stay...?
DESK CLERK: Oh, right, sorry!
Enjoy your stay -- LANA: No no no -
DESK CLERK: Mr. and Mrs. Archer!
LANA: Ughhh, it's like my heart's being gripped by the icy fingers of some terrifying Ghost of Honeymoon Future.
ARCHER: (chuckles) Lana. Lana! Lana!! C'mon, if you don't answer I'm gonna scream as
loud as I po ibly -- LANA: What?!
ARCHER: I'm sorry, I meant "Mrs. Archer."
LANA: mmmm MALORY: I heard you.
WAITER: I apologize, madame, but -- MALORY: For what, Dunkirk? Or that effeminate yet somehow condescending tone? Damn, I'm sure my card was in here... TRUDY BEEKMAN (O.S.): Malory, please, allow me...
MALORY: No no no, I'm -- TRUDY BEEKMAN: Embarra ing yourself, dear.
MALORY: Thank you, Trudy.
PAM: Oh man, this must be killin you!
CYRIL: What, the salmonella dripping all over my desk? PAM: It's lamb, ding-dong, not salmon.
CYRIL: I -- PAM: I'm talking about Mr. Archer and Lana! In a deluxe honeymoon suite!
CYRIL: Oh for -- Pam, they're on a mi ion!
PAM: Ary position! By now, since I bet they already did all the good ones...
CYRIL: Rrgh! Pam, they're -- PAM: Ungh ungh ungh ungh ungh ungh ungh ungh ungh ungh ungh ungh ungh
ungh ungh PAM: Want some?
CYRIL: I -- PAM: Psych! (theme music)
CYRIL: Okay, first of all, just shut up. And second, I trust Lana completely. Especially with regard to Archer. She'd rather have sex with... you.
PAM: Why, what'd she say?!
CYRIL: And third, Lana's pretty satisfied in the old romance department.
PAM: And the old accounting department...
CYRIL: What's that? LANA (O.S.): [sex noises] CYRIL (O.S.): [sex noises]
PAM: What's that?
CYRIL: Well good thing you work at a spy agency! Mi ... Spy On People!
PAM: What, I only watched for a second!
CYRIL: You need medication, Pam! Pills! Big pills, like they use at the zoo!
CHERYL/CAROL: But we have to go now, the vet comes back from lunch in twenty minutes!
CHERYL/CAROL: Let's go, bitches! Tiger tranqs!
CYRIL: We are not. Breaking into the zoo. To steal tiger tranquilizers.
CHERYL/CAROL: Cyril, they have all kinds.
CYRIL: And I have to direct- deposit the annual bonuses, so if you two could go be crazy and horrible elsewhere...?
PAM: Like the Tuntmore Towers Hotel, where Lana's shacked up with Mr. Archer...
CHERYL/CAROL: Wait, what?!
PAM: Yeah, we can see if he's into all that freaky gender-reversal stuff.
CYRIL: That -- wait, what?!
PAM: Cyril. I watched for more than a second.
CYRIL: I -- you -- CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah, let's go down there! I own that dump, we can get a suite and
totally spy on Mr. Archer and -- CYRIL: Lana! Okay, I'm going with you.
CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah whatever, but on the way we're --
PAM: Not swingin by the zoo. ARCHER (O.S.): Laaaaame.
LANA: What's lame, Archer?
LANA: The fact that we're up against at least four highly-trained North Korean agents? Or the fact they've all got -- ARCHER (O.S.): Peppercorns, Lana.
LANA: Well, I was gonna say Tokarevs and Shpagin-41 submachine guns, but yeah, let's go with peppercorns. ARCHER (O.S.): Thank you!
ARCHER: Because without peppercorns, it's not steak au poivre.
LANA: [annoyed sigh] ARCHER: It can't be. By like, definition.
LANA: Archer, we're supposed to be stopping the North Koreans from buying part of a nuclear bomb, not ordering every single item on the room service menu --
ARCHER: Just the dinner menu.
LANA: -- pounding two three- hundred dollar bottles of
Glengoolie Frickin Blue -- ARCHER: Two? I ordered three... LANA: -- then pa ing out on the bed totally naked, for a -- what'd you call it?
ARCHER: Power blackout. And you're welcome.
LANA: Yeah thanks, the memory of your bare a  will bring me comfort and warmth during the coming nuclear winter.
ARCHER: Relax, it's North Korea. The nationstate equivalent of the short-bus.
LANA: Nice.
ARCHER: What's nice is this hot tub. Which get in, before you blow our cover, any more than you already have, by not performing your wifely duties.
LANA: Excuse me?
MALORY: You said my card was used at the Tuntmore Towers Hotel? This morning?
MALORY: Hm? Oh yes, I remember now. Yes, yes, it's all fine, mmmmmkaybyebye. I am literally going to kill him.
GILLETTE: Well, figurative -- MALORY: Literally! I'll lure him to my condo in Miami, drug his steak au poivre, drive him out to the Everglades, slather him with rancid chicken fat, and then to  him to the gators!
RAY: Pretty specific for a hypothetical...
MALORY: Oh, he is going to pay for this. Literally. Cyril? Cyril. Ugh, fine! Then I'll do it! PAM (O.S.): Are they doin it?! Are they bangin?!
CYRIL: No, Pam, they are not "bangin."
PAM: Well these ribs sure as hell are.
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh my God, right? We should take some to the tigers!
PAM: And mi  these two doin it?
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh my God, right...
CYRIL: Will you hags stop it?! Look, there's nothing going on over there! CHERYL/CAROL (O.S.): Unle  she's screaming at him to get it up.
CYRIL: She's not -- PAM: That's what she was screamin at you. Okay, so I watched the whole thing.
CYRIL: Ugh, were you raised in a barn?!
PAM: No. I just slept out there a lot.
LANA: Sooo, you got an ETA on when you might po ibly be ready to help? ARCHER (O.S.): Hard to say, really...
ARCHER: Chi's taking her sweet time here. Not criticizing, thorough is good. Look, just gimme ten -- Twenty minutes, and --
LANA: Archer? I don't know how long the North Koreans will be out of their room, so while you ladies discu  the pros and cons of a clear
coat -- ARCHER: You say that like there are cons.
LANA: I'll go be thorough at my job and plant the Geiger counter, so we know if and when the uranium shows up.
ARCHER: Do you even know if that thing works?
[beeping noises] KRIEGER: Well, Pigley Three, that would certainly explain the glowing... And probably a few other things.
PIGLEY: Grunt
LANA: Why do you let him push your buttons? Why not push his buttons? Because he has no buttons. He's buttonle . The only way to make him as crazy as he makes you, is to... ha, ha, ha, haaaa PAM (O.S.): Seriously...
PAM: Who are you, Van Cliburn? Knock off the tickling and work that shit.
CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah, right? A baby could -- unghh!
MASSEUR: I'm sorry, Mi  Tunt! Did that hurt?
CHERYL/CAROL: Ye s...
PAM: Cyril, they bangin yet?
CYRIL: Wh-? No! Actually, Archer's alone... Lana's either in the bathroom or...
Oh my God! What -- ARCHER: The hell is this bullshit?!
CHI: What?! You say you want clear coat! LANA(O.S.): Yeah, why not? I mean it's not like it hasn't cro ed your mind, and you're not getting any younger, so -- ARCHER (O.S.): Lanaaa!
LANA: Jesus, what?! Is it the Koreans?!
ARCHER: Only if they're who screwed me out of my bonus! [crunch] Which would be weird! LANA (O.S.): Your bonus?!
ARCHER: If you could even call it that! What's yours, is it shitty?! Go online and check your bank account!
LANA: Now. When I'm suction cupped on a window, thirty stories above the ground. ARCHER (O.S.): Yeah, you should have five bars.
LANA: Okay so, it's gonna sound like I'm hanging up? But -- [BEEP]
ARCHER: Lana. Lana! Holy shit, I think she's gone rogue! But whoa, don't pack up. My toes aren't gonna do themselves.
LANA: And even if you're not nece arily doing it for the right reasons, he's -- ARHCER (O.S.) Hey! Hey!
LANA: [weary sigh] ARCHER: Phone, gimme!
LANA: Did you seriously climb all the way up here just to see what my bonus is?
ARCHER: No, I sarcastically climbed all the way up here to see what your bonus is! He said, sarcastically! Phone!
LANA: Okay, Jesus! Keep your voice... Whoa.
ARCHER: Sucks, right? I mean that's not even -- -- remotely fair! What the shit?!
LANA: Apparently we're in a crazy parallel universe, where bonuses are based on merit instead of whether or not you crawled out of your -- mother!
CYRIL: Lanaaa!
LANA: Archerrrrr!
ARCHER: I'm comiiiiing! Phrasingboom! Lanaaaa!
LANA: Aaaaaaaaagh! Wh-?!
ARCHER: Woooohoohoohooooo! Ungh!
LANA: Oh my God... Archer... that was...
ARCHER: A ninety-dollar manicure, I know. And I couldn't care le , but Chi... Lana, she worked really hard on it.
PAM: Oh man, they gotta bump uglies now!
CYRIL: They -- wait, what?!
PAM: Cyril, a near-death experience is like, the ultimate aphrodisiac!
CAROL/CHERYL: Penultimate. The ultimate's doing it on top of a tranqed up tiger.
LANA: So listen...
ARCHER: No you listen, and then shut up --
LANA: You shut up, I was on the verge of --
ARCHER: Dying.
LANA: Making a -- ARCHER: Stain on the sidewalk.
LANA: Decision! So -- ARCHER: So since we're keeping score for bonus purposes, Lana! In addition to saving your life a gazillion times --
LANA: Your fault to begin with ARCHER: Since I started working at ISIS, I've been shot, stabbed, set on fire, poisoned, shot, sexually a aulted, partially chewed, shot, and declared legally dead! Twice on the same day!
LANA: You said "shot" like three times.
ARCHER: That's just by you! Total it's more like... holy shit, nineteen! And now you get your bonus and mine?!
LANA: Archer, I didn't -- ARCHER: Do anything to deserve it! Exactly!
LANA: And again, excuse me?
ARCHER: There is no excuse for you.
LANA: Alrighty. Think I made my decision.
MALORY: And it is final. ARCHER (O.S.): Because I borrowed your credit card?!
MALORY: You didn't borrow it, you stole it! ARCHER (O.S.): Little column A, little column --
MALORY: Be advised! That until I say otherwise, Mister Stickyfingers...
ARCHER: Seriously, does this never dry? MALORY (O.S.): Lana is now agent-in-command!
LANA: Wait, what?
ARCHER: Yeah hang on, you're breaking up?
LANA: So, my first command, as agent-IN-command, she said commandingly, is -- PAM (O.S.): Get in my big ol vagina! I'm Lana!
CYRIL: Okay, you know what?
ARCHER: I am outta here!
LANA: Oh my God, okay, you're abandoning the mi ion to go home and pout?!
ARCHER: I'm not going home, I'm going down there to kick some Kim Jong A !
LANA: Wh-? No! We're doing surveillance!
ARCHER: Yeah, which is apparently French for just sitting around on your a !
LANA: Yeah, which is why it's surprising that you're so shitty at it! Wh-? No no no Archer don't --
[door slam] LANA: Suck so hard! Rrrgh!
CYRIL: Okay, c'mon, we're outta here.
PAM: What're you, nuts?
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh my God there's nuts in this?! PAM: Ugh, you're allergic to penicillin.
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh right. Aaand...
PAM: There's no penicillin in this --
CHERYL/CAROL: Good, cause I'm allergic.
PAM: -- because why the hell would there be penicillin in chocolate mou e?
CHERYL/CAROL: God, gro ! There's moose in this?!
PAM: Not that kind of moose.
CHERYL/CAROL: Elk then, whatever, ugh...
CYRIL: Look, you two stay if you want, I'm leaving. There's no point spying on Lana, because I trust her completely.
CHERYL/CAROL: And also because they're not even in there anymore?
CYRIL: Little column A, little column B.
LANA: You are not jeopardizing this mi ion!
ARCHER: No yeah, that's exactly what I'm doing. LANA: Because your ego needs its own zip code! I meant I won't allow you!
ARCHER: Allow me?! I mean please, allow me...
NORTH KOREAN AGENT: ISIS!
LANA: Unghh!
ARCHER: [chuckles] LANA (O.S.): [moaning)
ARCHER: Wow, that's gotta hurt, huh?
LANA: Archer...
ARCHER: No, obviously it hurts getting Tom Dempsey'd in the tits like that...
LANA: Archer.
ARCHER: But I meant watching me save your a  for the gazillion and one-th time.
LANA: Archer!
ARCHER: She's in command. ARCHER (O.S.): Oh okay, so I gue  you think this is my fault.
LANA: You gue ?
ARCHER: Well I'm not a mindreader, Lana!
NORTH KOREAN BOSS: Silence! We deal with you soon enough!
LANA: And by deal with, obviously, he means --
ARCHER: Shoot.
LANA: [SIGH] ARCHER: I mean, I a ume. And negativity is infectious, by the way. You're the agent-in-command, Lana, you should be focused on keeping
my morale -- LANA: Hi, excuse me? Could you go ahead and shoot one or both of us now?
ARCHER: Also a good leader is never sarcastic.
NORTH KOREAN BOSS: Oh, we don't shoot you! After mi ion finish, we take you back to glorious Democratic People's Republic of Korea!
ARCHER: Oh, then do go ahead and shoot us.
LANA: Archer!
ARCHER: What Lana, it's none of those things! Not democratic, not a republic, and definitely not glorious! Jesus, watch Frontline once in your life...
NORTH KOREAN BOSS: This ISIS camera, yes?
LANA: Uh...
ARCHER: Yes! And as all North Koreans know,
cameras steal your soul, so -- NORTH KOREAN BOSS: It is your Indians who think that!
ARCHER: Wow, okay, so since we're being racist...! PAM (O.S.): Cyril! Don't leave, it's on!
CYRIL: What do you...? On as in how on?!
PAM: On as in on on. CHERYL/CAROL (O.S.): On as in "hot Asian group sex" on...
PAM: Thricely redundant...
CYRIL: Give me those! [gasps] Oh my God! We've gotta do something!
[FRRRPT] PAM: It's rosemary-mint.
LANA: Why? Why did you say that?
ARCHER: To lure them closer. LANA: Well it worked.
ARCHER: Yeah, they really hate the Japanese...
LANA: You better have a plan. ARCHER; Me? Lana, you're agent- in-command.
LANA: Archer?
ARCHER: No, I just don't wanna step on your --
ARCHER: Toes!
NORTH KOREAN AGENT: Gaagh! ARCHER: Nailed it boom!
LANA: How did you...? ARCHER; Do you have any idea how many times I've had to get out of handcuffs?!
ARCHER: Lana!
LANA: Whew! Well, thank God you've been arrested so many times.
ARCHER: Arrested?
LANA: I -- look, whatever, thanks, that was actually pretty impre ive.
ARCHER: Well not really, I thought this was the door to the hallway.
LANA: Sooo...
ARCHER: Do you think there's thirty stories' worth of towels in here? NORTH KOREANS (O.S.): [angry shouting]
CYRIL: C'mon Figgis, Lana's in trouble, so you just gotta man up and... ooh! PAM (O.S.): Aw, man... am I mi ing all the hot Asian group action?
CHERYL/CAROL: No, nobody's doing anything... Well, Lana's destroying the toilet.
PAM: Join the club...
CHERYL/CAROL: That's what you get for eating elk.
LANA: [grunts] ARCHER (O.S.): Uh, couple things... One, we've got about thirty seconds before the door is matchsticks. Two, you're never gonna break that win -- [SMASH!]
LANA: What was that? I couldn't hear you over the sound of your wrongne .
ARCHER: It's okay, I'll skip ahead to three, which is now what, idiot?! Because I left my jetpack in my other pants!
LANA: I -- we can signal to somebody or --
ARCHER: Like who, a blimp captain?!
LANA: No, like -- holy shit, is that Cheryl?
ARCHER: What the hell's she doing -- CYRIL (O.S.): Suppre ing fire Extinguisher!!
ARCHER: Is that -- LANA: Cyril?! CYRIL (O.S.): Lanaaaaaaaaa!
LANA: I'm coming, Cyril!
ARCHER: Lana wait! Bet that's the first time you ever said that. Right? Okay, now we can go.
LANA: Ya know...?
ARCHER: Go!
LANA: Rrrgh!
ARCHER: What the -- LANA: Cyril!
ARCHER: Smoke fiiiiight! Woohoohoohooooo!
CHERYL/CAROL: Ugh, no way, that is so unfair! PAM (O.S.): What, are they bangin?!
CHERYL/CAROL: They will be... Raves make everybody horny.
LANA: [fighting sounds] ARCHER: And that! Is for ruining! My fake honeymoon!
CYRIL: Ungh! Oof! Archer wait, it's me!
ARCHER: I know!
ARCHER: Oof! And this is for the Pueblo! LANA: Cyril, hit the deck! ARCHER (O.S.): Wait, why just Cyri --
LANA: Get some you sons of bitches. Get some!
PAM: Aw man, I totally mi ed it...
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh my God, the toilet?! PAM: No! Jesus. Although it is clogged.
CYRIL: Wow, Lana, that was...
ARCHER: Right? Totally pa ive- aggre ive.
LANA: No, that was active- aggre ive! Because you ruined the mi ion!
CYRIL: Yeah, you jerk.
LANA: And why the hell are you here?!
CYRIL: Uh, police scanner?! LANA: Cyril.
CYRIL: Well, ya know, I mean you two, all alone in the honeymoon suite...
LANA: Oh my God.
ARCHER: [chuckling] LANA: Well you can forget about the huge decision I made, that you know nothing about, because I just unmade it.
CYRIL: I -- What was that all about?
ARCHER: Ohh, wouldn't you like to know...
CYRIL: Do you? ARCHER: No. LANA (O.S.): Malory, you cannot be serious!
MALORY: I know, I'm sorry, it's because I use humor as a coping mechanism.
LANA: I meant -- MALORY: And so, while I think it's hilarious that your bonuses will now be used to pay this ridiculous hotel bill... Which somebody could make go away with a snap of her bony fingers! CHERYL/CAROL (O.S.): Ugh! I told you, I have to answer to my board of directors! I don't, at all.
PAM: Do you even know what that is?
CHERYL/CAROL: I don't, at all.
MALORY: I just can't seem to find the humor in what should have been a simple mi ion turning into a total farce!
LANA: It wasn't -- ARCHER: Lana. It was by definition a farce.
MALORY: Capped off by the fact that no one thought to stick around and catch the madman selling the uranium!
ARCHER: Lana was in command.
MALORY: Yes, was.
LANA: (sigh) ARCHER: [chuckling]
MALORY: Lucky for the madman. Whoever he was...
KRIEGER: Aww, maaaan... Well there goes my master plan! Yeah, get in there, eat 'em up. God knows you earned it. (theme music)
