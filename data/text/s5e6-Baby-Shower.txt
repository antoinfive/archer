>> CHERLENE: * Got too much time And nowhere to go * * But I drink enough to say hello * * I'm not in love with anyone * But I'm high enough Not to give a... *
>> LANA: Goddamn it!
>> CHERLENE: Cut! Okay, whoa! Cut it, fellas! (music stops)
>> ARCHER: Man, I am blowing this jug.
>> CHERLENE: What the hell is wrong with you?
>> LANA: You are what's wrong with me! It's 5:50 in the goddamn morning!
>> CHERLENE: Uh, duh, it's called the golden hour.
>> LANA: The...
>> PAM: The light takes on a special quality.
>> LANA: I know what it means, but...
>> CHERLENE: Then you know it's the best time to record stuff, so...
>> LANA: Film! It's the best time to record things on film! It cannot po ibly have any effect on recording audio.
>> KRIEGER: Oh, was I supposed to be recording that?
>> CHERLENE: Krieger!
>> PAM: Goddamn it. (Cherlene growls)
>> CHERLENE: We're losing the light!
>> ARCHER: We're not losing me blowing this jug.
>> MALORY: Are you bothering them?
>> LANA: I am, and also, happy Opposite Day.
>> MALORY: Is she bothering you?
>> OTHERS: Yes!
>> MALORY: Stop bothering them. >> LANA: They're the ones...
>> MALORY: They are trying to make a record, Lana, and there is a finite amount of golden hour.
>> LANA: Which, again...
>> MALORY: I know, but if Cherlene's happy...
>> CHERLENE: Outlaw country, woooooo! (music playing)
>> MALORY: "Woo," exactly. Then I am happy. Or at least I will be, once we start selling some records.
>> LANA: I'll be happy when I can sleep without getting up to pee every six minutes.
>> MALORY: Pfft, you think you're not sleeping now? Wait till that thing's born.
>> LANA: Oh!
>> MALORY: So do yourself and those bosoms of yours a favor, and get a wet nurse.
>> LANA: That cannot still be a thing.
>> MALORY: Preferably one who cooks. We had a Dominican, just lovely, bosoms like... well, like yours, but umpteen babies later. My God, Sterling loved her. She was with us nearly four years. Now what was her name? I want to say Mariela? Maricela? Wait, or Ruby?
>> LANA: I don't...
>> MALORY: The point is, they steal from you; it's just the cost of doing busine . (Lana sighs)
>> LANA: Steal what? We haven't been paid in months, Malory; I'm pretty much broke.
>> MALORY: Join the club. Because believe me, if I had the money, I would get the hell out of this... Hillbilly Hilton.
>> KRIEGER: Am I supposed to be recording this?
>> PAM: Krieger!
>> KRIEGER: Watch it!
>> CHERLENE: Goddamn it!
>> ARCHER: Whoa! (jug shattering) Jug down! Jug down!
>> MALORY: As difficult as that would be. (Archer sobs)
>> ARCHER: I'm 'a plant a red fern for ya, jug.
>> MALORY: Item one: Woodhouse, scrape.
>> WOODHOUSE: Yes, mum. (all groaning)
>> MALORY: And gripe all you want, but no one is eating Eggs Woodhouse until you people start bringing in some money!
>> ARCHER: But they were already cooked; what good does it do to throw them away?
>> MALORY: None. That's the whole point. And no cocaine donuts for you! >> PAM (muffled): Aw, come on! I got to load up my body before Krieger sells it all!
>> ARCHER: Before what?
>> CHERLENE: What?
>> PAM: Krieger's selling the cocaine online.
>> MALORY: Are you insane?
>> KRIEGER: Yeah, if it's insane to use an X-gen asymmetric onion router and digital cryptocurrency to sell your cocaine anonymously and completely risk-free. Ah... Or a lot of the other shit I do.
>> MALORY: But... so do people e-mail you, or...?
>> KRIEGER: No. It's like shopping online, only for cocaine. I've already sold, uh... Wow, almost 800 grand worth.
>> MALORY: Really? But how do we get paid?
>> KRIEGER: With a totally untraceable digital currency that we can exchange for real U.S. dollars whenever we want. I call 'em Kriegerrands.
>> MALORY: And then how do they get the cocaine?
>> KRIEGER: We pack it up and ship it, easy peasy. At least in theory! (speaking Japanese)
>> MALORY: Oh, for... I'll send up some help. And, mi y, you had better watch it. (noisy chewing) >> ARCHER (mouth full): Jesus, these taste like calluses.
>> PAM: Ew.
>> CYRIL: Gro .
>> RAY: That's so accurate.
>> ARCHER: Lana. Lana. La...
>> CHERLENE: What's up her gigantic giant a ?
>> RAY: Wh... Probably you shitheads!
>> OTHERS: What did we do?
>> RAY: Besides keeping everybody up all night with your damn hootenannies...
>> ARCHER: Wait, that was a hootenanny?
>> RAY: ...has anybody even thought about throwing her a goddamn baby shower?!
>> CHERLENE: Ew!
>> PAM: Um...
>> CYRIL: Pfft, you mean a bastard sh... Ow!
>> ARCHER: Cyril, shut your pout-hole, accept the fact that Lana was so far out of your league that impregnating her would've basically been interspecies breeding, and get on with your life! And then go get a cake. Okay, Ray...
>> MALORY: Ray, Cyril, go help Krieger pack the cocaine. Cherlene, go pick or grin or something, and the rest of you...
>> ARCHER: We're throwing Lana a baby shower.
>> MALORY: Wh...? We haven't done that yet? I said move, people! Go, go, go, go, go! (Ray bleats) Idiots. All right, I need them here making music and packaging cocaine, so this baby shower is up to you. Don't cock it up like you did Texas!
>> PAM: Hey!
>> MALORY: Oh, blow it out your a ! (Pam farts) (Archer laughs)
>> ARCHER: I was hoping you'd do that. Okay, we should make a list.
Item one: some paper to write said list on. (gasps) Item two... Woodhouse! Get in here!
>> WOODHOUSE: Sir?
>> ARCHER: Here, here's... 400 bucks; go get all the stuff
for a baby shower: cake, decorations, some of those water guns shaped like dicks...
>> PAM: I think that's bachelorette parties.
>> ARCHER: Really? Wow, okay, that explains... Uh, never mind. And, Woodhouse, if you spend any of this on heroin, you better buy enough to O.D. on, bec...
>> WOODHOUSE: Will do!
>> ARCHER: Will don't!
>> PAM: Wait, so if Woodhouse is getting everything we need for the party, then...
>> ARCHER: Oh, not everything, Pam. Because... you and I are going to get Kenny Loggins to play Lana's baby shower.
>> PAM: Goddamn it.
>> ARCHER: Pam. Pam. (inhales)
>> PAM: What?!
>> ARCHER: * Danger zone. Wait, wait, wait, no. * This is it.
>> KRIEGER: Yeah, you guys box it up, I slap on a mailing label from the printer, bing bang boom, it's good to go zoom.
>> CYRIL: So, why are we in our underwear?
>> KRIEGER: Eh, don't worry about it.
>> PAM: Because it kind of seems like this is about you and not really about Lana.
>> ARCHER: Okay, A, Lana loves Kenny Loggins.
>> PAM: Really?
>> ARCHER: I don't know. I mean, I a ume she does. I do.
>> GUARD: Whoa, whoa, where you think you're going?
>> ARCHER: Uh, well, to give Mr. Loggins his wardrobe.
>> GUARD: Not without a pa you're not.
>> ARCHER: Yeah, we...
>> PAM: Hey, I appreciate you're just doing your job, but if Kenny doesn't get this embroidered hippie shirt and these gigantic bell-bottoms, I highly doubt you'll have a job tomorrow.
>> GUARD: Look, he ain't even here. He's probably still at the Tuntmore.
>> PAM: Now, was that so hard... neck nuts?
>> ARCHER: Good instincts back there, Pam. That's what we field agents call... Hmm. Gue  I'm not a field agent anymore though. (Pam laughs)
>> PAM: Man, you got to mi  it. What a rush!
>> ARCHER: Yeah, I mi  it, but calm down. Jesus, it's not like you killed a guy. Taxi! (car door closes) Okay, so phase two may call for some field craft. A, there's no way a superstar like Kenny Loggins is gonna be registered under his own name. >> PAM (laughs): Yeah. It's not like he's Me ina.
>> ARCHER: Don't do that. Don't ever do that!
>> PAM: Sorry! Geez!
>> ARCHER: You should be. Jim Me ina is a genius, and without him, no Poco. Where was I? Oh, yeah, we'll probably need to acce  the computer terminal at reception, so just follow my lead.
>> PAM: Could I just follow Kenny Loggins?
>> ARCHER: Wha...?
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Well, maybe because it's in the rider, which I'll be happy to come down there and shove up his a .
>> ARCHER: Uh, excuse me, Mr. Loggins? Hi, I'm, uh...
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
>> ARCHER: What the shit, Loggins?!
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Ricky, bad touch!
>> RICKY: Hands off Mr. Loggins!
>> ARCHER: Hands off me, Lurch. Look at my suit.
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Zap, Ricky, zap!
>> ARCHER: Hey... Aah! (Pam screams)
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Uh, hang on. Hit him again.
>> PAM: Wait! No, no, no, no!
>> ARCHER: What?! I... (grunting gibberish)
>> KENNY LOGGINS: What's that? No, no, never mind. It's just a fan. (Archer groans)
>> PAM: Holy shit zaps! Are you okay? (Archer coughs)
>> ARCHER: Yeah, and I don't know about you, but I'm gonna be pretty upset if I end up having to murder Kenny Loggins.
>> PAM: Meh.
>> ARCHER: Yeah, that's fair! Kick out the guy whose custom Super 220 wool suit was ruined by Kenny Loggins! And where were you during all that?
>> PAM: Oh, man, I was like, "What?!" So, what's up? What's the plan?
>> ARCHER: (sighs) The plan is shut up and come on.
>> GILLETTE: No, we have to play games at the baby shower. There's Don't Drop the Baby, uh, Dirty Diaper Game...
>> CYRIL: What in God's name is the Dirty Diaper Game?
>> GILLETTE: Oh, my God, it's hilarious. You get a bunch of newborn diapers, then you microwave different candy bars...
>> CYRIL: Stop! Yeah, let me just stop you there, because if you finish that sentence, I'm going to rub cocaine in your eyes until you are blind.
>> GILLETTE: Goddamn, Shawshank.
>> LANA: Uh, Malory? (Malory screams)
>> LANA: What?!
>> MALORY: What... do you want? Jesus.
>> LANA: I, um... Okay, so, as you know, or should know, I'm pregnant and...
>> MALORY: (sighs) Lana, it's too late to...
>> LANA: Okay, let me stop you. Having the baby-- don't know why that's such a mindbender for everybody, but... >> MALORY (chuckling): Well...
>> LANA: But... Hush. I have a lot of pretty major expenses coming up, and since we haven't been paid... (sighs) Look, I hate to ask, but I need...
>> MALORY: WIC!
>> LANA: What?
>> MALORY: It's like welfare but for babies. I don't know-- I'm not a Democrat. But I think they give you a birth cheese. (lock clicks)
>> LANA: A birth cheese.
>> MALORY: Oh, for... Nothing's ever good enough.
>> WOODHOUSE: Sorry. I only had $200.
>> MALORY: Not you. Really? $200?
>> ARCHER: Okay, there's $200 for the uniforms, $100 for the sweet wigs and another $300 for Kenny Loggins' room number.
>> HOUSEKEEPER: Mm-hmm.
>> PAM: So, I'm curious-- why didn't you just call Cherlene, who owns the hotel?
>> ARCHER: (sighs) And I'm curious-- why didn't you remind me about that until just now?
>> PAM: You said shut up, J. Alfred Gotrocks.
>> ARCHER: What?
>> PAM: We haven't been paid in forever. Where are you getting all this money?
>> ARCHER: I, uh... sold some artwork?
>> CHERLENE: Goddamn it! What did I tell you about staying up on the wall, ghosts?!
>> ARCHER: Okay, since I am or was a world-cla  secret agent, when we get up to his room, do actually follow my lead or...
>> PAM: Hang on, let me grab a name tag.
>> ARCHER: (gasps) Ruby! Ruby! Is there a Ruby? See if there's a Ruby. Is there a Ruby?!
>> PAM: It's pretty close to Ruby.
>> ARCHER: No, Pam, it isn't.
>> PAM: Well, why do...
>> ARCHER: Don't worry about it. Let it go. And give me one of those mints.
>> PAM: Dude, they're cocaine.
>> ARCHER: (sighs) Of course they are.
>> PAM: (laughs) Right?
>> ARCHER: All right, here's the penthouse. Now, I cannot stre  this
enough, Pam: follow my lead.
>> PAM: Okay.
>> ARCHER: Room ser... >> PAM: Housekeeping!
>> ARCHER: (clears throat) What did I just...
>> PAM: Prostitute! (gasps, grunts)
>> RICKY: What the hell is your problem?
>> PAM: Besides my face hurts?
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Why do I pay you 20 grand a month? I don't want to read about Kenny Loggins; I want to read about K-Log. (sighs) Jesus, don't ever get a publicist.
>> ARCHER: Well, as a lowly room service waiter, I probably won't, but... Wow. Okay, uh...
>> KENNY LOGGINS: K-Log didn't order room service.
>> ARCHER: Sure, you did.
>> KENNY LOGGINS: No, I didn't. (crash, gla  shatters) (Pam grunting)
>> ARCHER: A housekeeper and/or prostitute?
>> KENNY LOGGINS: You think K-Log needs to pay for sex, do you?
>> ARCHER: Mm... no, but, that being said, I do think he needs to reevaluate this whole K-Log thing.
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Oh, yeah? Well, I think you need to reevaluate your face.
>> ARCHER: My... Oh. (chuckles) Okay. I can explain that.
>> KENNY LOGGINS: How?
>> ARCHER: Uh... lip chemo?
>> RICKY: It's the crazy guy from the lobby. Which means you're no prostitute.
>> PAM: And, that being said, I am open to blow jobs for money. I only got eight bucks on me, but...
>> ARCHER: Pam! Self-esteem, buddy. Come on. Now, let's just put the gun down and...
>> RICKY: Mr. Loggins, please advise.
>> KENNY LOGGINS: K-Log. K-Log, damn it.
>> RICKY: Yeah, I'm kind of with him on that one.
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Oh, really? So you agree with Borgnar's pathetic little errand boy?
>> ARCHER: Wait, what? And also who?
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Well, I'll tell you the same thing I told Borgnar that night in Caracas. It's not for sale. At any price.
>> ARCHER: Who the hell is Bor... (grunts) (gunshot, gla  shatters) (Pam shouts) (Ricky screams) (gunshots)
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Hi-yah! (Archer grunts) Ricky, attack! >> PAM (chuckling): Yeah, Ricky. (Ricky and Pam grunting) (Ricky screams)
>> ARCHER: Okay. Okay, good. Pam, are you good? >> PAM (chuckling): Oh, yeah. (Ricky and Pam roaring) (Ricky and Pam grunting)
>> ARCHER: Yeah, good, okay. 'Cause this time, I may actually murder Kenny Loggins.
>> PAM: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
>> ARCHER: What, Pam?!
>> PAM: First see if he wants a beej. (crashing, fighting)
>> ARCHER: Loggins! Loggins! Now, look, before either of us does something we'll both regret, let's... (gunshots) Okay, that's just unacceptable. Pam, I'm going in!
>> PAM: Okay! (both grunting) (Archer grunts) (sniffing) (coughs)
>> ARCHER: Oh, wow, he really likes the Paco Rabanne. (gasps)
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Tell Borgnar I'll see him in hell!
>> ARCHER: Um, what the shit, Loggins?! (Kenny Loggins chuckles) Wonder if it's too late to get Me ina. Holy shit. What kind of colo al idiot would build a pool like that?
>> CHERLENE: I just want to go on record as saying that a gla  swimming pool on the penthouse balcony is, without a doubt, the absolute worst idea that I have ever heard in my entire goddamn life. But you're the men, so...
>> ARCHER: (chuckles) But can you imagine banging in that thing? Why, yes, Archer, yes, I can.
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Drop it! (gun cocks) Drop it on the ground.
>> ARCHER: Do you know how bad that is for it? I will place it on the ground, but...
>> KENNY LOGGINS: You think K-Log won't shoot, punk?
>> ARCHER: No, I think K-Log is out of bullets.
>> KENNY LOGGINS: What? (gun clicks) How did you...
>> ARCHER: It's just a thing I do. Now what the hell is in that briefcase?
>> KENNY LOGGINS: As if you don't know.
>> ARCHER: I honestly don't.
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Liar.
>> ARCHER: (chuckles) Look, I put my weapon down, I'm not a threat; how would I know what's in...?
>> RICKY: Aah! (Pam growling) (Kenny Loggins grunts)
>> ARCHER: Pam, no, no, no, no, no, don't, no, don't... (gunshot)
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Shit.
>> ARCHER: Ooh, okay. So one of... (gla  cracks) One fairly predictable thing is gonna happen now, so...
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Aah!
>> PAM and RICKY: Aah!
>> ARCHER: Loggins! (Loggins grunts)
>> ARCHER: Ooh.
>> KENNY LOGGINS: (coughs) You saved me. But why?
>> ARCHER: What do you mean why? (coughs) I wanted you to play a baby shower. (coughs)
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Wait, what?
>> ARCHER: The Dirty Diaper game? Water guns shaped like dicks? A baby shower.
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Oh. So, Borgnar? The briefcase?
>> ARCHER: I don't know anyone named Borgnar. And I don't want your crazy briefcase. What the hell is even in that thing?
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Don't worry about it. Just let it go.
>> ARCHER: I should let you go.
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Look, I'm... you know...
>> ARCHER: Sorry?
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Mm, more just embarra ed. Is there some way I can make this all up to you?
>> PAM: A beej!
>> ARCHER: Pam! And no, Kenny Loggins, there's no way to make up for almost killing me over a briefcase full of what I can only a ume is either plutonium or a human soul. (coughs) Although, that being said...
>> CHERLENE: It's in D minor; do you know what that is? Or even what chords are?
>> KENNY LOGGINS: (sighs) Yes.
>> CHERLENE: Wow, snotty. Okay, fine, so during the boring parts, just scream "outlaw country."
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Yeah, absolutely not.
>> CHERLENE: * Revvin' up your engine, listen to her howlin' roar... * (Lana squeals) Ugh!
>> ALL: Happy baby shower! (cork pops)
>> LANA: Oh, my God, you guys.
>> KRIEGER: Me first, here! It's a breast pump. Go ahead and use it now if you want.
>> LANA: I do not want, Krieger, but thank you. Aw, and thank you, Pam.
>> PAM: It's cocaine!
>> LANA: Oh, of course it is. And also, what the hell happened to you?
>> PAM: This big bastard.
>> LANA: What big...? Whoa.
>> RICKY: Uh, hi. Um, this is a car seat.
>> GILLETTE: Wha... Goddamn it! This whole stupid baby shower was my idea! (sobbing)
>> CHERLENE/LOGGINS: * Highway to the danger zone
>> KENNY LOGGINS: * I'll take you right into the danger zone... *
>> CYRIL: Here.
>> LANA: Oh, wow, a check. For $80.
>> CYRIL: Please take me back.
>> LANA: Aw, Cyril. Who's next?
>> MALORY: Well, I suppose me. And all of this. It's a layette. Onesies, binkies, itty bitty booties, blah blah blah. From baby Bergdorf's.
>> LANA: Oh, my God, it must've been a fortune.
>> MALORY: Well, I can afford it. Apparently, Krieger's online pharmacy is going gangbusters, so...
>> WOODHOUSE: Pardon me, mum. This was delivered for Dr. Krieger.
>> KRIEGER: What...? Not now, you shriveled...
>> MALORY: Wait a minute. That's the cocaine. So this whole thing was just a sham?
>> KRIEGER: Well, only if by "sham" you mean "sham."
>> MALORY: (growls) Krieger!
>> KRIEGER: Aah! But you were temporarily so happy!
>> CYRIL: Krieger, get back here!
>> PAM: Yay!
>> KENNY LOGGINS: * You'll never say hello to you until you get it on red line overload *
>> CHERLENE: * You'll never know what you can do until you get it up as high as you can *
>> CHERLENE/LOGGINS: * Go...
>> LANA: Wow. This baby shower actually went a lot better than I would've imagined.
>> ARCHER: Right?
>> LANA: And what happened to you?
>> ARCHER: Your present, Lana, is what happened.
>> LANA: And it's... where, exactly?
>> ARCHER: What, are you... are you kidding? It's...
>> WOODHOUSE: Right here, mi . (Lana gasps)
>> ARCHER: Wha... That's my crib! Uh, which I want you to have for the baby.
>> LANA: (gasps) Archer.
>> ARCHER: Because you're important to me, so I made Woodhouse get it from Mother's storage unit, because I own him.
>> LANA: Archer. (sniffles) Archer, that is the sweetest thing anybody has ever given me, ever.
>> ARCHER: Well, yeah. But, I mean, the big present, obviously, is, uh... "Danger Zone."
>> LANA: "Danger Zone."
>> ARCHER: The... Lana, the song.
>> CHERLENE/LOGGINS: * Highway to the danger zone Right into the danger zone... Ooh... *
>> LANA: Oh. Oh, okay.
>> ARCHER: "Danger Zone," Lana. You know, how I'm always saying "danger zone"?
>> LANA: Uh, kinda? Yes?
>> ARCHER: Well...
>> LANA: It's from a song?
>> ARCHER: Yes, it's from a song! Recorded by Grammy winner and po ible Faustian bargain-maker Kenny goddamn Loggins!
>> LANA: (chuckles) Okay, calm down. So who's Beard Guy?
>> ARCHER: (scoffs) Are you...? That's Kenny Loggins!
