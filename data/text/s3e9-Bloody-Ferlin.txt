LANA: Wait, here's an idea: you talk louder, and maybe they'll just come to us.
ARCHER: We'd lose the element of surprise Lana.
LANA: That was sarcasm!
ARCHER: No way, really? Because so was that, just now.
LANA: I pretty much insist that you shut up. Oh shit, they're in the armory.
ARCHER: Good, then we got 'em, this is the only way out.
LANA: Of the armory.
ARCHER: I heard you. And I can also read, so --
LANA: So what's in the armory?
ARCHER: Burglars, Lana, that's why I'm here and not up to my ears in stewarde .
LANA: What else is in the armory.
ARCHER: Well, there's a bunch of automatic weapons, rocket launchers, um, about a jillion grenades, oh. They may have fire superiority.
LANA: Ya think?
ARCHER: Lana, for all we know they're building a gundam-suit with bazookas for hands.
LANA: Really wish we had some backup.
ARCHER: Who, Cyril? Or ooh, maybe Ray could run over them with his wheelchair! That was also sarcasm, since apparently now we're saying whenever we do it.
LANA: Are you ready?
ARCHER: No. Sarcasm again, yes I'm ready.
LANA: What the hell are you doing? !
ARCHER: Nothing!
LANA: Archer!
ARCHER: What! The hell are you doing?
GILLETTE: Nothin. What're y'all doing?
LANA: The alarm company called us because the motion sensors were going off.
GILLETTE: Dukes!
LANA: Yeah, the rest of us got new keycodes Monday, but you were... where was it?
GILLETTE: Physical therapy.
LANA: For your limp, usele  legs.
ARCHER: Well it's obviously working, you're on a -- wait a minute! How the hell are you walking around on ladders? !
LANA: Because he's not paralyzed!
GILLETTE: And is that not the stuff of miracles?
LANA: You lying little --
GILLETTE: I never said I was paralyzed! Y'all just a umed I was!
ARCHER: Because you left the hospital in a wheelchair!
GILLETTE: They make you! And then I couldn't get a cab, so I just got back in the chair, and...
LANA: Spent the last six months pretending to be handicapped.
GILLETTE: Handi-capable.
ARCHER: So before I kick this ladder over in the hopes of paralyzing you for real, why are you in here stealing guns and grenades and what better not be my night vision goggles? !
GILLETTE: I kinda have some family problems.
LANA: So your brother, the drug dealer --
GILLETTE: He's not a drug dealer! He's a drug farmer.
LANA: Whatever, is gonna be murdered by your hometown's crooked sheriff?
GILLETTE: E.Z. Ponder, yes, and he used to bully me so bad in high school...
ARCHER: Nooo! Ray, that was sarcasm.
GILLETTE: Anyway, he wants Randy's dope farm for himself or he's gonna kill him, so I gotta go down there and... stop him.
ARCHER: Count me in.
LANA: What? ! Why? !
ARCHER: Well for one thing it's eerily similar to the plot of White Lightning. And this is Ray's brother, Lana. What's more important than family?
LANA: Getting hammered on moonshine and trying to bang skanky trailer-chicks?
ARCHER: Trying?
GILLETTE: Oh, that reminds me. They all think I'm married to like, a woman, so...
LANA: Oh alright, I'll be your beard.
GILLETTE: What're you, insane? "Hey y'all, here's my great big ol' black wife!"
LANA: Wh-?
ARCHER: Lana, c'mon. You're gigantic.
MALORY: Now what's all this nonsense about a break-in last night? I swear to God, if Krieger was doing more of his -- what's his new awful thing?
LANA: Ultimate Bum Shockfights, and no, it looks like it was an actual break-in.
MALORY: What? !
CYRIL: Jeezy Petes!
MALORY: Did they get into the mainframe? ! LANA: I... don't know, but --
MALORY: We need Sterling, where is he? !
LANA: He's tracking down, um, leads. From the clues. That there were some of.
CYRIL: What kind of clues?
LANA: The kind I'm gonna show you, if you're not too busy shutting up to come on.
MALORY: And put Sterling through to me the minute he calls in!
ARCHER: Which I gue  will be never... So, are there just no towers here? Or have we literally gone back in time?
GILLETTE: Both?
CHERYL/CAROL: Ow, you dumb idiot!
ARCHER: Great...
GILLETTE: Great...
CHERYL/CAROL: Why am I in a, whatever, dune buggy? ARCHER: Remember? We picked you up last night, said we were going on a trip?
CHERYL/CAROL: No, and to where? Six Flags Over The Shittier Parts of Chernobyl?
GILLETTE: Ferlin, West Virginia.
ARCHER: Yeah, and you and Ray are married.
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh my God oh my God oh my God!
GILLETTE: We're not actually --
ARCHER: Actually it'll be better if she thinks --
CHERYL/CAROL: We're marrieeeeed... GILLETTE: Super.
ARCHER: Ray, look out!
GILLETTE: Wh-? !
ARCHER: Two questions: is that the sheriff, and have you recently gone insane.
GILLETTE: Yes and no.
ARCHER: Respectively?
PONDER: Now I know that ain't who I think it is! No shit! Ray Gillet!
ARCHER: Gillet?
PONDER: How'n the hell are ya?
GILLETTE: Pretty good, E.Z. How you doin?
PONDER: Aw, can't complain. And nobody'd listen if I did!
ARCHER: I hear that.
PONDER: You hear what.
ARCHER: Not? That?
PONDER: What brings you back up the holler?
GILLETTE: Oh you know, just wanted to show off my pretty new bride to the home folks.
PONDER: She is that. For a minute there I's thinkin maybe you come back to help yer brother out with his... busine  concern.
GILLETTE: Naw, just back for a visit.
PONDER: Well, make sure it's a short one. 'Cause believe me when I tell you, ain't nothin you can do to help him. Y'all drive safe now, hear?
ARCHER: Man, is it me or is he super-menacing?
CHERYL/CAROL: Or super-hot?
GILLETTE: Hey! Remember? ! We're married? !
CHERYL/CAROL: Not until it's consummated.
ARCHER: I'll drive if you wanna hop back there and um enter her.
CYRIL: So not only is Ray not paralyzed, but his brother is a drug dealer -- LANA: Farmer.
CYRIL: And he and Archer are in West Virginia doing... what the heck are they doing?
PAM: Fighting a war on the war on drugs?
LANA: God damn it.
PAM: What, you shoulda looked under the stalls! LANA: I did! Wait, I did...
PAM: Yeah, I usually put my feet up on the grab bars.
LANA: Ugh, anyway, this is all obviously unauthorized, but I promised Ray we'd cover for him, so...
CYRIL: Oh, no! I'm not getting mixed up in this, and if Ms. Archer asks me --
MALORY: Why is it... That every time I need to use the restroom, you people are in here skulking around looking guilty?
PAM: Uh...
CYRIL: I'll tell you why they look guilty...
LANA: [small ahem]
CYRIL: Because they, or we I gue , don't know how to tell you that the break-in was a lot worse than we thought.
MALORY: How much worse? !
CYRIL: Uh, well, it's really hard to say...
LANA: But rest a ured we are on it, and Archer is on it, and... we're on it.
MALORY: Well I want an update in one hour! And why does it always reek of paint?
GILLETTE: Well, there she is... The old homestead.
CHERYL/CAROL: Jesus, what's my dowry? Tetanus?
GILLETTE: Ya know what?
ARCHER: Jesus RANDY: That's far enough, you sonsabitches!
GILLETTE: Randy, it's me! Ray! Your brother!
RANDY: Don't you move. Don't move a inch.
GILLETTE: Wh-? What do you mean "don't move"? ! I came home to help, you a hole!
RANDY: Well you ain't gonna be much help with your legs blown off. There's mines all in the yard.
ARCHER: Ray, to be honest, I'm having second thoughts about this whole thing --
CHERYL/CAROL: Get in line.
JANELLE: Randy Gillet, where are your manners? ! Get these folks the map of that damn minefield so they can come inside. I got some nice hot pie for 'em...
ARCHER: Okay, now I'm having third thoughts.
GILLETTE: Please don't.
ARCHER: It would be rude not to eat her pie. Which I a ume is not only hot but also moist. Although hopefully not flaky.
RANDY: And so E.Z. gimme a choice. Give him my whole dang operation and get outta the holler by sundown, or else him and his boys'll just take it, and grind me up into fertilizer.
GILLETTE: Well --
RANDY: But listen to me, just yappin. Tell me bout this pretty new wife of yours! 'Cause I'm kinda surprised to see you married. Homeboy knows what I'm talking about!
GILLETTE: He does?
RANDY: A New York City interior decorator?
ARCHER: That's what you went with?
GILLETTE: Betcher up to yer eyeballs in poontang!
GILLETTE: Oh. Yeah, just so many vaginas.
RANDY: No offense, darlin...
CHERYL/CAROL: None taken.
JANELLE: Want s'more of my pie, Mr. ARCHER:? GILLETTE: No!
ARCHER: Yes! Thank you, Janelle, I would love more of your moist and hot pie.
JANELLE: Well then open wiiide...
RANDY: Folks, we can't set around eatin her pie all day. We got a situation here.
LANA: So Krieger's running the logs to see if any files were acce ed last night.
MALORY: Who the hell could have done this?
LANA: Who knows? ODIN, the KGB, um...
KRIEGER: Actually --
LANA: But this'll take hours so we'll just bring you a report when he's done!
KRIEGER: Actually -- LANA: Krieger! More type, le  gripe.
MALORY: And has anyone heard from Sterling?
LANA: No, yes! He's out... on the case.
MALORY: Well, I want some answers, and soon.
KRIEGER: And since there's nothing in these logs, I too would like some answers.
LANA: So, here's the thing... RANDY: If I can just get what I got to my distributor, I can retire. Maybe move up to New York City with you.
GILLETTE: I -- what, where, do what? !
RANDY: I'm kiddin. Last thing you want's your redneck brother hangin around...
GILLETTE: No, it's not that, it's --
RANDY: Plus I'd rather kill myself. Nothin up there but a buncha you-know-whats.
GILLETTE: There are a lot of 'em.
RANDY: Don't see how you stand it. Anyhow...
ARCHER: Dude.
CHERYL/CAROL: Awesome.
GILLETTE: Sweet gracious God.
RANDY: This here's what E.Z. wants.
GILLETTE: How did you afford all this? !
RANDY: Farm subsidy.
JANELLE: He told the government he's growin corn, for that high-flooktose syrup. RANDY: But damned if I'm gonna contribute to the obesity epidemic.
ARCHER: A man's gotta have a code.
RANDY: Right? I put my heart and soul into this, but now it's either roll over for that sheriff like a dog, or fight. Like a different, better dog.
GILLETTE: So is it just E.Z. coming, or --
RANDY: No, the whole sheriff's department. I'd say twenty men, AR-15's, maybe grenades, uh... oh, dogs. Duh.
ARCHER: Ray, I'm having fourth thoughts.
RANDY: Well I got a few tricks up my sleeve. Janelle, why dontcha take Mr. Archer and show him the defensive perimeter.
JANELLE: I'd be delighted...
GILLETTE: No, no, wait a second --
ARCHER: Fifth thoughts!
GILLETTE: Archer! RANDY: Don't worry, she won't bite. But speakin of, it's about suppertime. You still partial to fried chicken?
GILLETTE: I --
CHERYL/CAROL: I'll cook it! If somebody shaves it or whatever.
RANDY: What in the...? Janelle? ! Janelle !
GILLETTE: Randy! Wait! Dukes!
CHERYL/CAROL: So is there like, special chickenshaving cream, or...?
GILLETTE: I -- first of all, that's a rooster!
CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah, like Kenny Rogers' Roosters -- GILLETTE: Roasters! Randy, wait!
CHERYL/CAROL: Bawk bawk.
RANDY: And just what the hell is this? !
ARCHER: Well, I'll tell you what it's not, which is, um, what it looks like.
JANELLE: I got caught on the fence, then Mr. Archer tried to get me loose, and --
RANDY: You better git yer a  in that house. Do you wanna have sex with my wife?
ARCHER: No I swear, this was just an extremely unlikely mishap with the barbed wire.
RANDY: 'Cause we would be amenable to that. Well? Why you look so nonplu ed?
ARCHER: Because I wasn't sure if you knew what amenable actually meant. Until you followed it up with nonplu ed.
RANDY: See, me and Janelle got us one of them open marriages? Like in France?
ARCHER: Oh right, in Europe.
RANDY: And I would really like that open marriage to include Ray's new wife.
ARCHER: What? ! RANDY: Now look, that's in the bible.
ARCHER: Really?
RANDY: Genesis thirty-eight, verse eight.
ARCHER: Really? RANDY: But even though Ray used to be a preacher he was never big on the Old Testament --
ARCHER: I could see that.
RANDY: So I doubt he'd wanna reciprocate. So I just need you to keep him busy while I have sex with his wife...
ARCHER: And then I get to have sex with --
RANDY: My wife, you son of a bitch!
ARCHER: Yeah, I think I got -- RANDY: So where the hell's your damn pants? !
ARCHER: They're on the fence.
GILLETTE: Goddammit, Archer!
ARCHER: Wait, hang on --
GILLETTE: Archer shut up! RANDY: Ray, he was -- and poor Janelle was -- I gotta go make sure she's okay! And you better have a talk with him!
GILLETTE: I will, Randy, I'm sorry.
RANDY: A good long talk. Like, talk for about forty, forty-five minutes.
ARCHER: Okay, so --
GILLETTE: Stop! I have never, in my entire life, been as disgusted as I am at this moment.
ARCHER: Well, give it a minute...
MALORY: What do you mean, a cyber-attack? !
KRIEGER: Apparently the intruders downloaded a virus into the mainframe... So this all needs to come out.
CYRIL: The mainframe is like Krieger's baby. How'd you get him to go in on this?
LANA: I told him I'd get Pam to fight in his Ultimate Bum Shockfights.
CYRIL: Is it called that because paying homele  men to fight is shocking?
LANA: Noop. PAM: Well, hello there, game-changer.
GILLETTE: He what? !
ARCHER: Yeah, apparently it's in the bible?
GILLETTE: No, it isn't! ARCHER: It did sound too cool for the bible. But why do you care? A, you're gay, and B, you and Carol aren't really married.
GILLETTE: But Randy thinks we are!
ARCHER: Yeah, but -- that's actually a really good point.
GILLETTE: I'm gonna beat him like a rented mule!
ARCHER: Now that sounds like something from the bible.
RANDY: She in there?
JANELLE: Yeah, where's mine at? RANDY: Up'n the woods with Ray. You gotta wait til later, maybe after supper.
JANELLE: Remember, no ki ing.
RANDY: I was -- that is the wierdest rule.
CHERYL/CAROL: I know, right? Some honeymoon. Oh hey, do I do the face?
MALORY: And where the hell is Sterling when I need him?
ARCHER: You've reached Sterling Archer's voicemail. Please leave a me age.
MALORY: Wh-? Finally, a non-idiotic greeting! Sterling, I want an update, so call me the instant you get this me  --
OPERATOR: The voice mailbox of...
ARCHER: Sterling Archer.
OPERATOR: ...Is full. Good-bye. ARCHER: Idiot.
JANELLE: C'mere, you skinny-legged sumbitch! Oh! Sorry.
ARCHER: That's okay, they're not my best feature.
JANELLE: No, I was --
ARCHER: Not important. What is important is that Randy gave me a bible le on?
JANELLE: Yeah? And what'd the bible say?
ARCHER: Well, Janelle, obviously the actual scripture is open to interpretation, but what I took away from it, is that we should go in the barn and screw our brains out on a huge pile of marijuana.
JANELLE: It didn't say nothin about a rubber, did it?
ARCHER: It did not!
JANELLE: Ray's still up in the woods, right? ARCHER: Uh... oh. No, he actually said he wanted to talk to --
GILLETTE: Randy!
RANDY: Whoa whoa whoa now hang on a second!
GILLETTE: You wife-swappin white trash piece of -- RANDY: Ray, no! [Gunshots]
JANELLE: Randy!
ARCHER: Yes. Randy. Which I probably should've mentioned earlier.
ARCHER: Don't judge me. Food.
RANDY: You lucky I didn't kill you.
GILLETTE: You're lucky I didn't kill you! While you were in bed with my wife!
CHERYL/CAROL: Our marriage was never consummated! And I think we all know why...
GILLETTE: Stop!
ARCHER: Carol! Look, there's plenty of blame to go around here. I mean, I don't think I deserve any, but --
GILLETTE: You were gonna screw her!
ARCHER: Yeah so, is that still on, or...?
JANELLE: Wh-? ! ARCHER: Carol?
GILLETTE: Wh-? ! Well, sombody. C'mon, promises were made.
RANDY: Just like you promised Mama'n Deddy you'd always take care of me!
GILLETTE: And here we go!
RANDY: But they weren't even cold in the ground before you were galivantin around Europe!
GILLETTE: It was the Olympics! RANDY: Which you lost!
GILLETTE: Bronze medal! Is not losing!
RANDY: And then it was off to New York City!
ARCHER: You can just say New York.
RANDY: To be a hoity-toity interior decorator! ARCHER: You can just say decorator.
RANDY: Whatever, I don't know why I thought he could help save my farm! Because your job? ! That's a job for si ies!
GILLETTE: Oh yeah? ! Well gue  what!
ARCHER: Ray! Is not an interior decorator.
GILLETTE: I -- no, ya know what?
ARCHER: Yes, shut up. Randy, your seemingly effeminate brother is actually a highly-trained secret agent.
RANDY: Pshh! Yeah, and I'm... something equally hard to believe is true.
CHERYL/CAROL: It is true. That's why I married him. Well, and the bronze medal.
JANELLE: Prove it.
ARCHER: What do you want, a busine  card? Where do you think he got a duffel bag full of a ault weapons?
RANDY: Well, y'all do live in New York City...
ARCHER: Just New York.
RANDY: Ray? Is he tellin the truth?
GILLETTE: Mostly.
RANDY: So... cause you're a spy, is that why you never come back to visit?
GILLETTE: Mostly. RANDY: And here all this time I thought it was cause you were ashamed of us.
GILLETTE: Oh c'mon now, why would you think that?
RANDY: I found a buncha your old diaries.
GILLETTE: Well, obviously not the one with the Mi  Piggy on it. RANDY: No, Deddy said he burned that one.
GILLETTE: Ugh, great...
RANDY: And I'm sorry I screwed your wife.
GILLETTE: And I'm sorry if I ever made you feel like I was ashamed of you. RANDY: The important thing is you came back to help me.
GILLETTE: C'mon, that's what family's all ab -- [Explosion]
GILLETTE: Dukes!
ARCHER: Shit!
RANDY: Dammit! PONDER: Randy Gillet! This is Sheriff E.Z. Ponder! You come out there with your hands up!
RANDY: That sonuvabitch is early!
ARCHER: I dunno, "sundown" sounds more colloquial than like, an actual --
RANDY: Well, if you wanna back out on me, now's probly the time to do that.
GILLETTE: Randy, you may be a racist, homophobic, wife-swapping drug dealer -- RANDY: Farmer.
GILLETTE: -- but nobody murders my brother.
RANDY: The Gillet boys, side by side! Janelle, cover that winder yonder! Archer, you got a little fight in ya?
ARCHER: [Burps] Yeah, I'm pretty furious about not getting to bang Janelle. Plus I wanna unleash the power of moonshine.
RANDY: Then grab a gun and cover that winder!
CHERYL/CAROL: What should I do? !
RANDY: I got some red hot pokers layin in that fire! If anybody gets hit, you grab one and slap iron to it!
CHERYL/CAROL: Awesome...
RANDY: And remember, it's us or them. So this is how it's gonna be, huh? !
PONDER: Randy, I didn't want it like this! C'mon, I tried to reason with ya!
RANDY: Reason with this!
PONDER: A'ight then! Light 'em up!
JANELLE: Ow!
RANDY: Janelle! Are ya hit? !
JANELLE: Naw, a piece of -- waaaaaghhhhhh!
RANDY: Well don't just set there! Shoot!
ARCHER: Ugh, I can't. I feel sick, what's happening, do I have cancer again?
GILLETTE: You drank too much!
ARCHER: That's a thing?
RANDY: Looks like it's just you and me, brother. PONDER: Randy, you don't have to do this! They'll go easy on you! Hell, the judge is my wife's cousin! I bet he'll give you probation!
GILLETTE: Oh please! You're gonna murder him so you can take over his dope farm!
PONDER: What? ! Cease fire! Hold your fire! Why in the world would you think that I, a peace officer sworn to uphold the law, would wanna murder your brother to get his marijuana farm?
GILLETTE: I -- because that's what Randy said!
PONDER: Randy's a drug dealer!
RANDY: Farmer! PONDER: And I tried to get him to quit. I come to him as a friend, I come to him as an elder of the church, but he wouldn't give it up. And so now I gotta come to him as the law. And you accuse me of plannin a murder? !
GILLETTE: Well, you did used to pick on me a bunch.
PONDER: Well I'm sorry, I was a dick in high school. But you gotta admit, you were extremely pick-on-able.
GILLETTE: There's nothing wrong with Capezios! Randy, is he telling the truth?
RANDY: Mostly.
GILLETTE: Randy! You almost got me and my friends killed! Because you could never be bothered to get a real job!
RANDY: Well? ! I only got to ninth grade! How the hell else was I supposed to earn a livin? ! Diggin sign? !
GILLETTE: There is a perfectly good coal mine not a half-mile from here. And maybe you wouldn't get rich, but at least it's an honest living.
RANDY: Yeah but it's hard.
GILLETTE: So's this.
JANELLE: Randy!
GILLETTE: Shut up. And Mama never liked you. Easy, don't shoot! I'm comin out!
ARCHER: Phrasing.
PAM: Here's the files you had me pull.
MALORY: Oww! What the hell is on your hands? !
PAM: My bum-zappers. For the shockfights? That I'm doing for Krieger, which is why he broke the server, to help Lana cover up that Ray and Mr. Archer are killing cops for a drug dealer and also Ray's been faking that he's paralyzed?
MALORY: Lanaaaa!
PAM: Or are we not telling you that?
CHERYL/CAROL: No, thank God you guys got here before they started killing hostages! Which would have been us! As the hostages!
JANELLE: You lyin-a  bitch!
CHERYL/CAROL: She's mad because I slept with Randy. To get food for my fellow hostages.
RANDY: So, you really think you can fix it so I just get probation?
PONDER: Oh God no, I just said that. All these drugs and weapons, attempted murder of police officers, you'll probably die in prison.
RANDY: Oh. Will you come visit me?
GILLETTE: Probably not.
RANDY: Cause you're a spy and all?
GILLETTE: Uh -- RANDY: He's a highly-trained secret agent.
PONDER: Is that right. Well listen here... If you ever find your way back up in the holler... gimme a call.
GILLETTE: Uh --
PONDER: I think I got myself an extra pair of Capezios layin around somewheres.
GILLETTE: Uh-? ! O.K. - should I just 911?
PONDER: A'ight, let's move em out!
ARCHER: Well that's just great. Everybody gets laid in the holler but me. Well, and you, I gue . Since I ate your husband. Dan Lather
