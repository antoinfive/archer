>> ARCHER: Mawp. Mawp. Mawp! (groans) Was that a flashbang?
>> MALORY: Sterling?
>> ARCHER: Mawp? Ow!
>> MALORY: Do something.
>> ARCHER: What? I brought roses. Jesus, Mother, it's just your birthday, not the...
>> MALORY: About that!
>> ARCHER: Oh. Duh.
>> LANA: Archer!
>> ARCHER: (gasps) Lana! >> LANA (mocking): "Lana!" Ugh. (slurping) Not her birthday.
>> ARCHER: Ah! (grunts)
>> CHERYL/CAROL: No, move! Get away from us!
>> PAM: Yeah, they're shooting at you!
>> ARCHER: Who?
>> CHERYL/CAROL: The storm-ninjas!
>> ARCHER: What? That's not a thing, idiot! Oh. I stand corrected.
>> LANA: Son of a...! Bitches, I am pregnant!
>> CYRIL: Yes! (laughs) Who could forget? With the bastard spawn of a total stranger.
>> LANA: Okay, first of all... Cover your eyes and ears!
>> CYRIL: You're not the bo of me! (explosion) (high-pitched ringing)
>> CYRIL: Meep? Meep? (laughs)
>> LANA: What's that, Beaker?
>> ARCHER: Oh, my God, is Beaker not the best? Meep, meep, meep! And wait, what's his, uh... the name of... Brett!
>> BRETT: No, no, no, leave me alone!
>> ARCHER: Shut up. Who's Beaker's bo ?
>> BRETT: What?
>> ARCHER: Beaker's bo .
>> BRETT: Goddamn it, I can't hear...
>> ARCHER: Brett? Well, he died doing what he loved. Getting shot.
>> CYRIL: Meep. Meep.
>> LANA: Archer! Who the hell...
>> ARCHER: Shut up, it's on the tip of my tongue!
>> LANA: What is?!
>> ARCHER: Beaker's bo !
>> LANA: What?
>> GILLETTE: She meant who the hell are these guys, you big dumb idiot a hole!
>> ARCHER: Said the guy in a wheelchair!
>> GILLETTE: What the...?
>> ARCHER: I just frickin' got here, Ray! How the hell should I... No...
>> LANA: No, no, no, no, no, no...
>> CYRIL: What, what're you...? Oh.
>> GILLETTE: Oh, boy.
>> AGENT: FBI! Nobody move! FBI! (Malory sighs wearily)
>> MALORY: Second worst birthday ever.
>> ARCHER: What? How is this better than your second fake 50th?
>> HOLLY: Oh, come on, guys, we talked about this! You're supposed to yell "FBI" at the beginning. After the flashbangs, but before Other Fat Mike gets shot.
>> AGENT: Ow.
>> HOLLY: And what happened with getting "FBI" on the fronts of the uniforms, huh?
>> AGENT: Ow!
>> HOLLY: Huh?
>> ARCHER: Uh, what happened with since when the hell does the frickin' FBI get off...
>> HOLLY: Sterling Archer?
>> ARCHER: Yes! What?!
>> HOLLY: I'm Special Agent in Charge Holly, and you are extremely under arrest.
>> ARCHER: (laughs) For what?
>> HOLLY: Uh, in addition to the attempted murder of a federal agent?
>> ARCHER: Yes.
>> HOLLY: Well, there's gonna be just a whole bunch of charges, but mostly treason.
>> ARCHER: Treason?
>> LANA: What? Archer, what'd you do?
>> HOLLY: No, no, not just him. You, too, Mi  Kane.
>> LANA: What?!
>> HOLLY: Yeah. Everybody. Especially you, Ms. Archer.
>> LANA: Is this about the fake hydrogen bomb?
>> MALORY: Lana!
>> HOLLY: No, but let's put a pin in that. This is about conducting espionage operations, for years, with no authority or permi ion whatsoever, from the United States government. (Lana gasps)
>> ARCHER: Wait, what? Mother!
>> LANA: Like, 50 times I asked you about that!
>> MALORY: And like 50 times I lied. Sue me. I want my phone call. >> AGENT (over radio): Uh, sir? It's like you said, he's dug in there like a tick, and... >> KRIEGER (over radio): Never! You'll never take me alive! (Holly sighs wearily)
>> HOLLY: Okay, breach it.
>> AGENT: Roger that. (explosion)
>> KRIEGER: On second thought, I very much prefer to be taken alive. Just let me clear the ol' browser history and... No, no, no, no, no... oof! Oh, come on!
>> HOLOGRAM: Ooh, G-man-san.
>> ARCHER: I'm serious, you are not putting those on me.
>> HOLLY: Mr. Archer, please turn around and place your hands behind your back.
>> ARCHER: (laughs) Or what? What are you gonna do, taser... (Archer gibbering) (Archer sputters) (Cheryl/Carol gasps)
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Do me! Do me! Do me, do me, do me!
>> HOLLY: I'm not tasering you, so just...
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Do me! (Holly grunts) (taser clicking, Cheryl/Carol groaning) (Cheryl/Carol sighs) Thank you.
>> MALORY: Ugh. Our tax dollars hard at work. (laughing): Well, not mine, obviously, but...
>> HOLLY: What's that?
>> MALORY: Damn it.
>> ARCHER: Whatever, Cyril. I don't care who you are, when you get zapped with 50,000 volts, it's like, like...
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Sploosh. And then it's like wave after wave crashing over you, into you, and...
>> ARCHER: Will you shut up?
>> PAM: You shut up. Let her talk.
>> ARCHER: You shut up!
>> PAM: Make me! (shouting, grunting) (Malory whistles loudly)
>> ALL: Ow! Ow!
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Jesus!
>> MALORY: All of you. Shut your various holes and listen to me very carefully.
>> CYRIL: Why, so you can tell us more lies?
>> KRIEGER: Yeah. (all muttering)
>> MALORY: So I can save you from life in prison! Sorry, Ramona, I know to you it's just one big sexy briar patch, but...
>> GILLETTE: You know...
>> MALORY: Zip it! That goes for all of you! And when we get in there, you keep it zipped. Because there's a chance I can make this all go away, but only if you people don't try to save your own necks by ratting out everyone else! (all muttering)
>> MALORY: Damn it, trust me! And say nothing! You heard me, J. Edna.
>> LANA: Not one word.
>> ARCHER: Well, except for those three. And then those five. And...
>> LANA: Archer!
>> ARCHER: Then that one.
>> CYRIL: I really shouldn't say anything. I mean, unle  you can guarantee me...
>> GILLETTE: Total immunity.
>> CHERYL/CAROL: And I mean from everything.
>> GILLETTE: Including anything you find on my computer. Or in my crawlspace.
>> PAM: Oh, and throw a bone into me. >> AGENT 2: Excuse me?
>> GILLETTE: I said Ms. Archer had an affair with the head of the KGB for, like, 30 years. >> CHERYL/CAROL (laughs): Yeah, until he got blown up. Which was actually my fault.
>> CYRIL: Because she was busy having choke-sex with a murderous cyborg, who then became the new head of the KGB.
>> KRIEGER: Until I built a sexier one out of illegal Soviet parts. And a corpse.
>> PAM: There was no shortage of dead bodies around ISIS.
>> GILLETTE: One of which belonged to the prime minister of goddamn Italy.
>> CYRIL: Oh, Jesus, I forgot about the...
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Giant pot farm in West Virginia.
>> PAM: And this whole other thing with the Yakuza.
>> GILLETTE: Irish Mob.
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Piracy.
>> CYRIL: White slavery.
>> PAM: No, actual piracy. With, like, boats.
>> CHERYL/CAROL: I want to say... Burt Reynolds?
>> CYRIL: Poaching alligators...
>> GILLETTE: Smuggling Mexicans...
>> KRIEGER: Defiling a corpse...
>> CYRIL: Defiling a different corpse...
>> PAM: Kidnapping the Pope...
>> CHERY/CAROL: (laughing) Faking my own kidnapping! Arson.
>> PAM: Bumfights! You know, like when you pay bums to...
>> CYRIL: Destroy an oil pipeline in...
>> CHERYL/CAROL: I want to say Burt Reynolds.
>> CYRIL: ...Turkmenistan?
>> KRIEGER: Ode a. You know, the ratlines?
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Where you make it look like a murder-suicide, but...
>> KRIEGER: Is it murder if they were my own clones? I'm seriously asking.
>> GILLETTE: Oh, because, speaking of sexual a ault... >> PAM (munching): Which time? 'Cause for one of 'em I got a pretty good excuse. >> AGENT 2: Can I stop you? Please?
>> PAM: That's what he said. (Pam clears throat) Inappropriate.
>> CYRIL: Geez, when you just list everything ISIS has done, it sounds kind of bad. >> AGENT 3: And so if I were you...
>> ARCHER: You'd get laid a lot more? >> AGENT 3: I'd start talking. Everybody else is! They're in there right now, saying he's the brains behind ISIS.
>> LANA: Ha!
>> ARCHER: Exactly, I... Hey, screw you!
>> LANA: Screw you! Mr. My Mother's A Lying Bitch And I'm Too Stupid To Realize My Life's A Pathetic Joke!
>> ARCHER: Oh, nice to meet you, Mrs. Hello My Kid's From A Sperm Bank Since I Can't Keep A Man Because In Addition To My Jillion Neuroses I Have A Weird-looking Vagina! (Lana gasps) (Archer and Lana grunting) >> AGENT 3: Okay, knock it off. Hey! (FBI Agents grunting)
>> ARCHER: I can't believe they fell for that.
>> LANA: Ahem. Mi  what?
>> ARCHER: Sorry, it-it's not that weird look... Lana! (gunshot)
>> ARCHER: Thought you were gonna shoot me.
>> LANA: Day's not over.
>> ARCHER: And seriously, Lana, sorry for what I said. Then that's where you say... (Archer yells)
>> LANA: Good-bye, Archer.
>> ARCHER: Where do you think you're going?
>> LANA: Not to jail with you and your mother.
>> ARCHER: Well, you know, we can ask the judge...
>> LANA: You know prisons aren't co-ed, right?
>> ARCHER: Oh. Okay, we got to get out of here.
>> LANA: "We"? There is no "we" anymore, Archer! Well, there's this we...
>> ARCHER: Uh...
>> LANA: Oh, shit.
>> ARCHER: Yeah. You're gonna be a great mother.
>> LANA: I could start smoking crack today, and he'd still turn out better than you.
>> ARCHER: And why is that? Because I never had a father, Lana? So why don't you shut up, and then also marry me.
>> LANA: What?!
>> ARCHER: I'm serious-- we can go underground, get new identities, and spend the rest of our lives together, Lana. We'll be a family. You, me, the baby and your not-that-weird-looking vagina.
>> LANA: Okay, don't take this the wrong way... but I would rather lose the baby.
>> ARCHER: Wha... I...
>> LANA: Okay, that-that wasn't... I didn't...
>> ARCHER: Excuse me. (Lana sighs) (Archer laughing)
>> ARCHER: Jesus Christ, come on, you idiot. (Lana grunts)
>> CYRIL: "I have read this statement, each page of which bears my initials, and I do hereby certify..."
>> PAM: "That the facts herein are true and correct, signed Pamela Poovey."
>> CYRIL: "Cyril Figgis."
>> RAY: "Raymond Q. Gillette."
>> KRIEGER: "Algernop Krieger."
>> CHERYL/CAROL: "Cheryl and/or Carol Tunt." Now, I would like a ride home, please. Preferably in an Apache helicopter.
>> PAM: And I believe there was some mention of throwing a bone into me? >> FBI AGENT 2: What are you talking about?
>> PAM: A penis in my vagina. Or wherever, but come on, chop-chop, I got to go start enjoying my immunity. (FBI Agent 2 laughs) >> FBI AGENT 2: Yeah, you said immunity. I didn't.
>> RAY: Dukes!
>> CYRIL: God!
>> KRIEGER: Damn it!
>> CHERYL/CAROL: So is that a "no" on the Apache, or...? (knocking) >> FBI AGENT 4: Oh, my God, okay, so this ditz... Oh.
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Now who's the ditz, huh?
>> LANA: Would you just come on?
>> CHERYL/CAROL: I'm seriously asking.
>> PAM: Aw, but look at him. All tied up like a sexy little Christmas ham.
>> CYRIL: And can I just go on record as saying I think this is an extremely bad idea?
>> LANA: You know what's a bad idea? Prison.
>> ARCHER: Because, spoiler alert, they're unisex.
>> PAM: Hello, best part.
>> HOLLY: Yeah?
>> ARCHER: Uh, uh... >> CHERYL/CAROL (old lady voice): Oh, Clyde? Clyde, is that you? It's me, dear, Mrs. J. Edgar Hoover's mother.
>> HOLLY: Um... it's open. Ma'am.
>> ARCHER: Nobody move! Or...
>> MALORY: What the hell are you doing?
>> ARCHER: Getting us out of here.
>> MALORY: I've already done that. Let him go. And you'll just have to put that on my... whatever... crime tab.
>> HOLLY: No, no, no, no, no. Taking a federal agent hostage is a separate charge.
>> MALORY: Oh, well, then perhaps we should get  him back on the phone.
>> HOLLY: I... that... I-I don't... There's no need to bother the... Eh, look. If you'll just sign this form...
>> MALORY: Doo, doo, doo. "In lieu of criminal prosecutions for..." Doo, doo, doo... "Treason, I hereby forfeit ISIS headquarters. (all groaning) And also agree to permanently cease and desist any and all ISIS operations." (all gasping)
>> ARCHER: Oh, my God.
>> HOLLY: Or face a mandatory sentence of life in federal prison without parole.
>> ARCHER: You got to be kidding me.
>> MALORY: "Signed, Malory Archer."
>> LANA: Oh, my God.
>> ARCHER: No, uh-uh, nope. Because correct me if I'm wrong, but that entire document is completely unenforceable. I correct you. You are wrong.
>> MALORY: For God's sake, Sterling, it's the government. Even if it weren't legal, they'd enforce it.
>> HOLLY: Hey, save it for four ninths of the Supreme Court.
>> MALORY: Oh, shut up. And unle  there's anything else?
>> HOLLY: Uh, just this, releasing the bureau from any claims relating to the death of your employee... Brett, uh, Bunson?
>> ARCHER: Oh, my God!
>> LANA: What?
>> ARCHER: Beaker's bo ! Bunsen frickin' Honeydew! Woooooo!! (groans) That was figuratively killing me.
>> ARCHER: I can't believe they're taking our building.
>> LANA: Screw the building! What about our jobs? Oh, and our health insurance. Which I'm pretty sure I'm gonna need.
>> KRIEGER: I'll be your doctor.
>> LANA: Well, if I want Hitler's DNA spliced into him, I'll give you a call.
>> KRIEGER: Yeah, I'm around.
>> MALORY: Well, as for me, I think I'll start shopping my memoirs. How does the title  Secrets and Silk grab you?
>> ARCHER: Tightly by my childhood's throat.
>> MALORY: Oh, you're just jealous.
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah, jealous of my fallback career. >> PAM (laughing): As what? An actual acorn?
>> CHERYL/CAROL: As America's number one country singer.
>> LANA: And kudos. But for the rest of us trapped in the realm of po ibility...
>> CHERYL/CAROL: I'm gonna be bigger than Mac Davis. And Mac Davis can totally suck it.
>> ARCHER: And you can all suck it because I am gonna play profe ional lacro e.
>> LANA: Okay, even if that were a real thing...
>> ARCHER: Is it not?
>> LANA: ...you are way too old.
>> ARCHER: I am not... Oh, my God. I am way too old. (cracks knuckles)
>> PAM: Welp, hope I'm not too old to get back into underground fighting.
>> CYRIL: Darn. All those jobs are awesome.
>> LANA: And by awesome you mean delusional.
>> CYRIL: Because it's gonna be hard to go back to an accounting firm after this job.
>> ARCHER: Especially after Mother gives you a shitty reference. Mother, do that.
>> CYRIL: I meant it'll be boring. Although, I gue I could always go back to being a defense attorney. (all groaning)
>> LANA: When were you ever a lawyer?
>> CYRIL: Lana, we had long talks about this. How I went to night school to pa  the CPA exam because I was so burned out defending scumbags as a public defender? Numerous... long talks.
>> LANA: With me?
>> CYRIL: Oh, for... (Archer laughs) Well, don't come crying to me when that fatherle  kid of yours buys a gun and steals a car, and he tries to run but he don't get far!
>> CHERYL/CAROL: * In the ghetto where Mac Davis sucks it. *
>> ARCHER: Are you done?
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Are you done?! Again, seriously asking.
>> ARCHER: Yes. So I gue  we should talk about the elephant in the room. Namely... What are we gonna do with literally, not figuratively, a ton of cocaine?
>> MALORY: Well...
>> LANA: Wha...? Oh, come on!
>> ARCHER: What, Lana, we must be talking...
>> CYRIL: Wholesale? Uh, 50, 60 million? >> LANA (laughs): Wholesale. So, what, we form a cartel?
>> MALORY: Well, how hard could it be? I mean...
>> LANA: Don't.
>> MALORY: ...if Mexicans can do it. (ice clinks in gla )
>> ARCHER: $50 million, Lana. We sell this and we're out. I promise.
>> MALORY: Dr. Krieger has devised a way to transport the cocaine undetected.
>> ARCHER: You're probably gonna want to try to minimize the sweating. We're gonna go ahead and take the cocaine and the money.
>> MALORY: What do you mean counterfeit?
>> ARCHER: The Yakuza?
>> MALORY: Amphetamines?!
>> ARCHER: Well, Pam screwed the Yakuza out of a million bucks of amphetamines, so now they're gonna cut her head off.
>> CHERYL/CAROL: * Baby, please don't go *
>> ARCHER: Get down!
>> CHERYL/CAROL: * Baby, please don't go *
>> MALORY: Ron!
>> ARCHER: Yeah, this is actually a little harder than I thought.
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Because I don't fly.
>> ARCHER: So, you've only got 24 hours to drive to Texas? (laughing) Did you tell anybody we were hauling a shitload of coke?
>> CHERYL/CAROL: * Yeah, your girl done gone down to the county farm * Take me with you! Outlaw country! Woooooo!!
>> MAN: Honey, you're number 14 nationwide.
>> ROY ACUFF: How bout a big ol' country welcome for Cherlene!
>> CHERYL/CAROL: * Before I be your dog get you way down here Make you walk alone Baby, please don't go * Woooooo!!
>> SANTOS: Incredible. I must meet this woman.
>> CYRIL: Well, what do you think is gonna happen when three gringos waltz in and start asking around for the woman who runs the entire Cali cartel?
>> ARCHER: Wooohooohooohoooo!! (man grunts)
>> LANA: Are you sure you cannot make love to me just once more?
>> ARCHER: Not without a blood transfusion.
>> LANA: Very well.
>> ARCHER: Ow! Ow! Ow! (yells)
>> CHERYL/CAROL: * Baby, please don't go down to New Orleans You know I love you so Baby, please don't go *
>> LANA: You're doing the exact thing you promised me you wouldn't!
>> ARCHER: I was kidding. (tiger growls)
>> CHERYL/CAROL: * Before I be your dog Before I be your dog *
>> SANTOS: Welcome to San Marcos.
>> CHERYL/CAROL: * Before I be your dog get you way down here And let you walk alone *
>> CYRIL: So, couple things.
>> ARCHER: Oh, goddamn it. Did you fart in that?
>> CHERYL/ CAROL: * You know how I feel right now? * (grunting) * My baby's leaving (laughing) * On that midnight train (siren blaring) * And I'm crying
>> CYRIL: Suppre ing fire!
>> CHERYL/CAROL: * Baby, please don't go *
>> ARCHER: Goddamn it, Cyril!
>> CHERYL/CAROL: * Baby, please don't go Baby, please don't go *
>> HOLLY: You're running out of options, Archer.
>> CHERYL/CAROL: * Baby, please don't go *
>> SANTOS: I want Archer dead!
>> CHERYL/CAROL: * Baby, please don't go down to New Orleans You know I love you so Baby, please don't go *
>> MALORY: I think you just stumbled backwards into a CIA arms deal. (Cheryl/Carol screams) (explosion)
>> RAY: They kidnapped Cherlene!
>> LANA: Archer!
>> PAM: We just started a frickin' coup!
>> CHERYL/CAROL: * Before I be your dog get you way down here Make you walk alone Baby, please don't go, yeah *
>> LANA: Archer, my water just broke.
>> CHERYL/CAROL: * All right now. *
>> ARCHER: And for what it's worth, I'm pretty sure I just invaded Laos. (woman speaking Vietnamese) And, Chi, I swear to God, mention the compa  again and just see what happens. (tiger roars)
