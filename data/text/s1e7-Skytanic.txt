Archer: [ CHUCKLES ] WHO WOULD WANT TO PUT A BOMB ON THAT? WELL, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HOPING ISIS CAN FIND OUT.
Archer: NO, WHY BOTHER? SOME BROAD GETS ON THERE WITH A STATICKY SWEATER AND, BOOM, IT'S, "OH, THE HUMANITY!" - [ SOBS ] - NO, NO, THAT'S --
Malory: STERLING.
Lana: WERE YOU WATCHING SOME OTHER BLIMP COMMERCIAL JUST NOW? TECHNICALLY, IT'S A RIGID AIRSHIP.
Malory: FILLED WITH HELIUM.
Lana: WHICH IS NONFLAMMABLE. DUMBASS. I THOUGHT OUR PROMOTIONAL VIDEO COVERED THAT FAIRLY WELL.
Malory: OH, AND HOW. STERLING, IT'S TOTALLY SAFE. WELL, EXCEPT FOR THE BOMB THREAT.
Malory: NO, NOT TO WORRY, DEAR. ISIS WON'T LET TERRORISTS BLOW UP YOUR LOVELY BLIMP. [ SIGHS ] RIGID AIRSHIP.
Malory: MY TOP TWO AGENTS WILL BE ON BOARD.
Archer: NOPE!
Malory: AND I WILL OVERSEE THE OPERATION PERSONALLY FROM WHAT I ASSUME WILL BE FIRST-CLASS ACCOMMODATIONS. OOH, ACTUALLY, WE ARE FULLY BOOKED.
Malory: WELL, IF YOU THINK -- OH, I DON'T KNOW -- THIS TRUDY BEEKMAN PERSON CAN THWART A MAJOR TERROR PLOT -- I SUPPOSE WE COULD BUMP MRS. BEEKMAN.
Archer: BUMP ME. I'M NOT GOING. IF THESE TWO CAN SHARE A CABIN.
Lana: NOPE!
Archer: NOT GOING TO LET THE TERRORISTS WIN. WE'LL POSE AS HUSBAND AND WIFE.
Lana: NOPE! CYRIL WOULD TOTALLY FREAK.
Archer: HA.
Lana: MALORY, COME ON, LET ME STAY WITH YOU, AND WE'LL DO THE WHOLE OPRAH/GAYLE THING.
Malory: NOPE! I NEED A STATEROOM TO MYSELF, IN CASE I HAVE A GENTLEMAN CALLER. UM...
Archer: MOTHER, PLEASE.
Lana: PLEASE. DO NOT MAKE ME DO THIS.
Malory: BUT, LANA, THINK OF THE INNOCENT LIVES YOU'LL BE SAVING AND ALSO THE FACT THAT THIS IS A DIRECT ORDER.
Lana: AT LEAST, TELL ME IT'S SEPARATE BEDS. WELL, UM...
Lana: ICK.
Archer: [ CHUCKLES ] LANA. LANA. LANA. LAN-A-A-A!
Lana: WHAT? [ CHUCKLES ] * DANGER ZONE
Cyril: TERRIBLE, AWFUL, JUST GUT-WRENCHINGLY BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS.
Lana: BABY, I REALLY NEED YOU TO TRUST ME, OKAY? NOW, IS THE CABIN SMALL? YES.
Archer: AND YET, SURPRISING AMOUNT OF STORAGE.
Lana: UGH, AND I WILL HARDLY BE IN HERE, OKAY, BECAUSE I'VE GOT A TERRORIST TO FIND, AND I DOUBT HE'S HIDING UNDER --
Archer: WHAT'S BASICALLY A TWIN BED.
Lana: ARCHER!
Archer: SINCE IT'S ALL DRAWERS UNDER HERE BECAUSE LOOK HOW TINY THIS ROOM IS.
Malory: OH, MY GOD. IT'S LIKE A BROOM CLOSET.
Archer: AND YET A SURPRISING AMOUNT OF STORAGE.
Malory: OH, SHUT UP. AND, CYRIL, VERY EAGER TO KNOW WHY YOU'RE STILL HERE.
Lana: HE WAS JUST --
Cyril: HELPING LANA GET SETTLED.
Archer: TRUST ME, CYRIL. SHE ALREADY SETTLED.
Lana: HEY!
Cyril: HEY!
Archer: HEY! Malory: HEY! DISEMBARK, CYRIL. WE'RE ABOUT TO LAUNCH... OR WHATEVER BLIMPS DO. YEAH, WHAT DOES A BLIMP DO, PAM?
Pam: UH, KICK YOUR SKINNY ASS! NOW, COME ON. WE GOT TO GET OFF THIS THING BEFORE -- RELA-A-A-X. GOD, WE'VE GOT HALF AN HOUR. OH, WELL, THEN, MAKE ME A DOUBLE CAMPARI AND, UH... I GUESS, VODKA. WE DON'T NORMALLY DRINK ON THE BRIDGE.
Archer: WELL, I DON'T NORMALLY FLY ON THE  HINDENBURG 2.0, SO... IT'S NOT THE HI--
Lana: AND CYRIL DOESN'T NORMALLY STORM OFF WITHOUT EVEN KISSING ME GOOD-BYE.
Archer: SO WE'RE ALL OUT OF OUR COMFORT ZONE.
Malory: NOT ME. MY STATEROOM IS GORGEOUS. OH.
Malory: THAT -- WHAT'S HER NAME? -- BEEKMAN, I BET SHE'S JUST SICK SHE GOT BUMPED. YES, SHE LITERALLY VOMITED FROM ANGER, SO IF WE COULD JUST FOCUS ON THE BOMB THREAT.
Lana: HOW ABOUT CREW MEMBERS? ANYONE WHO MIGHT BE DISGRUNTLED? UM... ACHTUNG! THAT'S LIEUTENANT KRAUSS. HE AND I WERE BOTH UP FOR COMMAND OF THE EXCELSIOR, BUT --
Lana: YOU GOT IT. LEAVING HIM WITH MOTIVE. [ German accent ] RELEASE THE MOORING CABLE.
Archer: COME ON, IT'S NOT LARRY LUFTWAFFE. THAT'S -- [ BANG! ]
Malory: OOPSIE. [ GIGGLES ]
Archer: UGH, WAY TOO OBVIOUS.
Pam: GOD DAMN IT! WE'RE MOVING! I KNOW!
Pam: WHAT HAPPENED TO HALF AN HOUR? I LIED.
Pam: WH-- WHY THE --
Cyril: WHY THE HELL ARE YOU TWO STILL HERE? BECAUSE I KNEW YOU'D BE HERE BECAUSE YOU DON'T TRUST LANA WITH MR. ARCHER.
Cyril: NO, NO, NOW, THAT IS -- SO IRONIC, CYRIL, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF RECENT...
Cyril: NO. ...RUG-BURNY EVENTS.
Pam: [ Laughing ] OH, MY GOD! YOU TWO BANGED?!
Cyril: I, UH -- SEE, HERE'S THE THING. UH, FRUIT BASKET!
Pam: WOW. YOU ARE JUST A DOG IN A MANGER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, PAM. I DIDN'T GROW UP ON A CHEESE FARM.
Pam: OH, FOR THE -- IT'S CALLED A DAIRY. AND EVEN THE SLIGHTEST HINT OF A PROBLEM ON OUR MAIDEN VOYAGE WOULD KILL EXCELSIOR'S  STOCK PRICE.
Malory: SO, LANA, CANVASS THE PASSENGERS AND CREW, LEARN WHAT YOU CAN ABOUT KRAUSS -- BUT, PLEASE, BE DISCREET.
Lana: HEY, GOOD ADVICE! WHICH MAYBE I'LL JUST SORT OF FOLD IN WITH MY 12 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AS A COVERT OPERATIVE!
Malory: DON'T BE SNOTTY!
Archer: HA!
Malory: AND, STERLING, IF THERE IS A BOMB, CAPTAIN, DEAR, WHERE WOULD IT DO THE MOST DAMAGE? PROBABLY --
Archer: UH, THIS NEW PLACE CALLED ANYWHERE. THIS WHOLE THING'S A BOMB. IT'S NOT --
Archer: JESUS! WANT TO BLOW US ALL TO SHIT, SHERLOCK?!
Malory: STERLING!
Archer: WHAT?! FOR THE LAST TIME, THE  EXCELSIOR IS FILLED WITH NONFLAMMABLE HELIUM! ALTHOUGH THIS IS A NON-SMOKING AREA, SIR. DAMN IT, HE'S A PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR.
Archer: NOT AFTER THAT, I BET. FORGET ABOUT KRAUSS. THERE'S YOUR BOMBER.
Lana: WHO?
Malory: WHAT?!
Archer: THAT GUY. BEARDSLEY McTURBANHEAD.
Malory: YOU IDIOT. THAT'S SANDU SINGH, THE BILLIONAIRE INVESTOR. HE'S A SIKH.
Archer: OH, SO IF HE'S NOT A MUSLIM, HE JUST GETS A PASS? WELL, THAT'S CALLED PROFILING, MOTHER, AND I DON'T DO IT. MR. SINGH IS EXCELSIOR'S  MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER.
Archer: SO? IF ANYTHING WENT WRONG ON THIS FLIGHT, HE'D LOSE MILLIONS.
Archer: IT'S A PERFECT COVER.
Malory: STERLING.
Lana: JUST GO LOOK FOR THE STUPID BOMB.
Archer: RELAX, WHAT DO WE HAVE, LIKE FOUR HOURS BEFORE WE GET TO LONDON? Lana: FOUR HOURS?
Malory: ARE YOU JOKING? THE CROSSING TAKES 24 HOURS.
Archer: ARE YOU JOKING? WHAT? RIGID AIRSHIPS COMBINE THE PAMPERING OF A CRUISE SHIP WITH THE SPEED OF --
Archer: SOME OTHER SLIGHTLY FASTER SHIP? UH, HELLO. AIRPLANES? YEAH, IT'S BLIMPS. YOU WIN. BYE. [ Laughing ] OH, GOD. I HOPE YOU DIDN'T INVEST IN THIS. IT'LL BE FINE, THOUGH...
Archer: BLIMPS ARE TERRIBLE. ...AS LONG AS NOTHING GOES WRONG ON THIS FLIGHT.
Malory: OH, CAPTAIN, MY CAPTAIN, WITH ISIS ON BOARD, WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG? PICK ONE. EITHER "A," I TELL LANA WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT SCRATCHY GREEN OFFICE RUG, OR TWO, YOU GET INSIDE ME.
Cyril: OR, "C," MAYBE I JUST JAM THIS MOP INTO THE ENGINE AND KILL ALL OF US. I DON'T THINK THAT'S HOW BLIMPS WORK.
Cyril: DARN! RIGHT, WE JUST SORT OF FLOAT AROUND. STUPID, NATURALLY SAFE HELIUM. BUT I AM LIKING THE JAMMING IMAGERY. AND THE KILLING.
Cyril: AND ARE YOU JUST GONNA SIT THERE?
Pam: YEAH, UNTIL SHE TAGS ME IN.
Cyril: WHAT?! Pam: [ Laughing ] I'M KIDDING! MY BACK'S ALL MESSED UP.
Pam: SO, YOU'RE RUINING CYRIL'S LIFE BECAUSE, IN YOUR DREAM-THE-IMPOSSIBLE-DREAM WORLD, IT'LL MAKE MR. ARCHER JEALOUS? OH, PAMELA. YOU READ ME LIKE A POEM.
Pam: YEAH? WHAT'S THE POEM GONNA BE ABOUT WHEN CYRIL SNAPS AND MURDERS YOU? I DON'T KNOW. WORLD'S GUSHIEST ORGASM?
Lana: CAN YOU JUST GET OUT OF THE WAY?
Archer: WHAT? ARE YOU GONNA SHOOT ME AGAIN?
Lana: YES!
Archer: OH. WELL, THEN, HANG ON.
Lana: CYRIL IS ALREADY FREAKED OUT ENOUGH ABOUT US SHARING THIS SHOEBOX WITHOUT YOU AIR-DRYING YOUR UNKEMPT BUSH.
Archer: UNKEMPT BUSH?! UM, YOU'RE ONE TO TALK!
Lana: [ GASPS ] MY VULVA IS SMOOTHER THAN A VEAL CUTLET! WHAT TERRIBLE TIMING.
Cyril: OH, REALLY?
Lana: BABY --
Cyril: DID I INTERRUPT SOMETHING?
Archer: UH, REHEARSAL WITH YOUR COMMODORES TRIBUTE BAND.
Lana: ARCHER! CYRIL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
Cyril: I WANTED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT, BUT APPARENTLY, YOU'RE TOO BUSY SHOWING OFF YOUR VEALY VULVA!
Lana: CYRIL! YOU KNOW, YOUR WHOLE TRUST THING -- AND I'VE TRIED TO, OKAY? YOU KNOW WHAT? WE ARE ON A BREAK!
Cyril: OH, YEAH?
Lana: YEAH!
Cyril: WELL, THAT'S FINE BY ME! Lana: CYRIL, WAIT! NO RUNNING!
Cyril: SHUT UP!
Lana: OH, MY GOD. WHAT HAVE I DONE?
Archer: WHAT ARE YOU DOING? GO AFTER HIM.
Lana: OH, YOU THINK I SHOULD?
Archer: YES! WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF FRUIT. WHICH IS WHY I FIND IT STRANGE THAT YOU'RE SO INCREDIBLY CALM!
Malory: WELL, THAT SEAWEED WRAP JUST SLURPS OUT THE STRESS. CAN'T WAIT TO TELL TRUDY BEEKMAN ALL ABOUT IT, UH, IF WE EVER MEET. [ SIGHS ] WHAT ABOUT YOU? ANYTHING ON KRAUSS?
Lana: NO. SHUT UP. HAVE YOU SEEN CYRIL?
Malory: WHY WOULD I HAVE?
Lana: UH... AND WHAT THE HELL IS HE  DOING?
Archer: HEY, WHAT DID I TELL YOU, HUH?!
- OH! - Archer: HUH?! THERE! GO BUY A NICOTINE PATCH! [ GLASS SHATTERS ] [ CLEARS THROAT ] GENTLEMEN. NO, NO, NO! WHAT HAPPENED TO DISCRETION?
Lana: WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT BARTENDER?
Malory: RIGHT? GUY SEES AN EMPTY GLASS, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE'S JUDGE CRATER. OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE! NIGEL, SOME CHIPS FOR MR. --
Archer: ARCHER. [ CHUCKLES ] STERLING ARCHER. THE MINIMUM BET IS 10,000, SIR -- DOLLARS.
Archer: OH, I STUFFED ALL MY MONEY IN THAT GUY'S MOUTH. WELL, PERHAPS WE COULD PLAY FOR SOMETHING MUCH MORE  INTERESTING.
Archer: YEAH, 'CAUSE THAT WAS SERIOUSLY, LIKE, ALL THE CASH I HAD ON ME, SO... SO, IF I WIN, I SPEND A NIGHT OF PASSION WITH YOUR EXQUISITE WIFE.
Archer: MY WHAT? [ GLASS SHATTERS ] OH, YES, MY WIFE. OF COURSE. YEAH, IT'S A DEAL. BUT IF I WIN, YOU TELL ME WHERE THE BOMB -- BACCARAT!
Archer: WHAT? MR. SINGH WINS.
Archer: WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. WE WERE GOING? THE VON ZEPPELIN SUITE. I SHALL EXPECT HER WITHIN THE HOUR.
Archer: SHE'S NOT GONNA BE HAPPY ABOUT THAT. UM, WHAT, ARE YOU MOSTLY PAID IN TIPS? ALMOST ENTIRELY, SIR.
Archer: HUH. [ CLEARS THROAT ] MM-HMM.
Malory: WELL, WHOSE FAULT IS THAT?
Lana: I -- YOU --
Malory: PRANCING AROUND IN YOUR FIACCI KNOCKOFFS, BLATHERING ABOUT YOUR VULVA? Lana: HEY, FIRST OF ALL --
Malory: I'M JUST SAYING, YOU'RE DRIVING CYRIL STRAIGHT TOWARD ANOTHER WOMAN.
Lana: [ LAUGHS ] CYRIL? WITH ANOTHER WOMAN? MALLORY, SERIOUSLY. LOOK AT ME. LOOK AT ME!
Cyril: [ GROANS ] LOOK AT AND CHOKE ME! OH, YES, YES!
Cyril: OH, MY GOD, WHAT AM I DOING?
Pam: YOU'RE RUINING YOUR LIFE, YOU IDIOT! [ CHUCKLES ]
Pam: AND MAKING IT HARD TO DROP A DEUCE.
Lana: UH, I'M SORRY, WHAT?
Archer: YOU. NOW. LED ZEPPELIN SUITE.
Lana: YOU HAVE NO PROOF SINGH'S THE BOMBER.
Archer: HE HINTED, LANA...
Lana: THAT'S PROFILING.
Archer: ...THAT THE PROOF WAS IN HIS CABIN.
Malory: REALLY?
Archer: YES! SO GO DOWN THERE AND FIND IT WHILE I GO FIND THE BOMB.
Malory: UGH. BOMBS, BOMBERS, VULVAS. YOU PEOPLE ARE JUST RUINING MY TRIP.
Archer: UH...
Malory: WELL, DON'T STAND HERE GAPING AT ME! GO THWART SOMETHING! NO RUNNING!
Archer: ZIP IT, ZIPPERFACE! OH!
Archer: OH, KIDDING, SORRY. HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN THAT NERDY FRUIT-BASKET STEWARD? UH, CHECK THE KAISER WILHELM SUITE.
Archer: MAN, YOU REALLY NEED NEW NAMES ON THE -- HEY, WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN THERE? THINGS FOR AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY, SO DON'T GO IN THERE. IT'S VERBOTEN!
Archer: AH, OKAY. PROBABLY MERITS A FOLLOW-UP.
Cyril: ARCHER?
Archer: CYRIL, WHAT ARE --
Cyril: ARCHER, I NEED YOUR HELP. I THINK I'M LOSING IT HERE, MAN.
Archer: WHAT GAVE IT AWAY? MY MOTHER'S -- WHY ARE YOU WEARING MY MOTHER'S ROBE?!
Cyril: I CAN EXPLAIN THIS!
Archer: I DON'T THINK I WANT YOU TO.
Cyril: SEE, IT ALL STARTED WHEN YOU AND LANA -- Archer: CYRIL, YOU SHOULD TELL HER THIS.
Cyril: I TRIED! BUT YOU WERE NAKED, AND IT WAS ALL VULVA THIS AND VULVA THAT.
Archer: YEAH, AND AS YOU STAND HERE, DICK AND/OR BALLS CARESSED BY MY MOTHER'S ROBE -- UGH! -- LANA IS WAITING FOR YOU.
Cyril: REALLY? WHERE?
Archer: THE LED ZEPPELIN SUITE.
Cyril: THERE'S A VON ZEPPELIN SUITE. Archer: WHICH I'M SURE IS WHAT I MEANT, SO GO!
Cyril: THANKS, ARCHER. YOU'RE THE BEST.
Archer: I KNOW. [ CHUCKLES ]
Cyril: SO, YES, THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT I WAS UNFAITHFUL TO YOU TWO -- WELL, THREE TIMES, I GUESS, IF A DRY-HUMPY CHOKER COUNTS. AND IF YOU CAN'T SEE IT IN YOUR HEART TO FORGIVE ME, I WILL FORGIVE YOU. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT LOVE IS, LANA. IT'S FORGIVEY. WHICH IS NOT A WORD. COME ON, FIGGIS! ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO. [ GASPS ]
Lana: OH, WHY? HELLO.
Cyril: SO, THAT'S YOUR IDEA OF A BREAK, HUH?
Lana: OH, CYRIL, IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.
Malory: WELL, THEN, WHAT IS IT? Pam: OKAY, SO, CYRIL GOT IN OVER HIS HEAD.
Malory: JESUS GOD, DID HE KILL HER?
Pam: NO, NO, NO. HE RAN FROM HER TO GO CONFESS TO LANA. BUT, SO, THEN THIS ONE STARTS FREAKING OUT, AND LONG STORY SHORT, I KIND OF HAD TO DROWN HER IN THE TUB.
Malory: SO, YOU KILLED HER? [ COUGHING ]
Pam: APPARENTLY NOT, SO... GOOD NEWS.
Lana: SHUT UP, PAM. AND DID CYRIL RUN BY HERE CRYING IN A WOMAN'S BATHROBE?
Malory: WELL, IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME. YOU'RE DRIVING HIM STARK RAVING MAD.
Lana: WHAT DID I DO?
Malory: WHAT YOU DO? RUNNING AROUND ALL UP AND DOWN THIS STUPID BLIMP --
Pam: AGAINST THE RULES.
Malory: ...HALF-NAKED, TITS BOUNCING AROUND LIKE YOU'RE AT A RODEO, THEN GOING BACK TO SOME BILLIONAIRE'S SUITE?
Lana: I WAS TRYING TO STOP A BOMB PLOT.
Malory: OH, MY GOD. THERE IS NO BOMB!
Pam: MORE GOOD NEWS.
Lana: AND JUST HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
Malory: UGH. BECAUSE I MADE THE BOMB THREAT. TRUDY BEEKMAN BOOKED THE VERY LAST TICKET ON THIS FLIGHT, SO IT WAS ALL, "MEH, MEH, MEH, I'M TRUDY BEEKMAN. I'M ON THE CO-OP BOARD, AND I'M GOING ON A BLIMP. MEH!" SO, YES, I MADE A PHONY BOMB THREAT.
Pam: GOOD FOR YOU.
Lana: [ SIGHS ] AND YET YOU LECTURE ME. [ RINGING ] LOVELY.
Archer: MM, YELLO!
Lana: SO, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF I TOLD YOU THAT YOUR MOTHER MADE A PHONY BOMB THREAT JUST TO GET A FREE RIDE ON A BLIMP?
Archer: I'D SAY THAT'S FAIRLY CLASSIC HER.
Malory: OH, SHUT UP.
Archer: AND THEN I'D JUST SORT OF LAUGH... [ BEEPING ] ...AT THE, UH, UM -- THE WHATCHAMACALLIT... IRONY? [ BEEPING ]
Lana: THERE'S ACTUALLY A BOMB ON BOARD? ARCHER? ARCHER -- OH, WHAT THE HELL?! WHERE THE [BLEEP] ARE YOU GOING?
Archer: I GOT TO GET MY TURTLENECK.
Lana: WHAT THE --
Archer: I'M NOT DEFUSING A BOMB IN THIS. NO RUNNING!
Archer: SHUT UP! OH, AND, LANA, MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO GRAB THE KRAUT. HE'S THE BOMBER. [ GUN COCKS ]  GOTT IM HIMMEL! WHAT IS THIS?!
Lana: YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS, FRITZ, SO SHUT YOUR SCHNITZEL HOLE AND DISARM IT. AH, I GET IT. THE GERMAN GUY MIT THE SCAR MUST BE THE BAD GUY. WELL, YOU KNOW HOW I GOT THIS SCAR? SAVING A JEWISH GIRL FROM A GANG OF SKINHEADS.
Lana: OH, JESUS. YEAH!  UND SO KRAUSS GETS A CURB PARTY.
Lana: WOW, NOW I FEEL LIKE AN ASSHOLE. YOUR WORDS.
Lana: BUT COULD YOU BE A LAMB AND DISARM IT ANYWAY? YEAH, PROBABLY. [ GUNSHOTS ]
Lana: WHA--
Archer: OKAY, I GOT THE TURTLENECK AND MY WIRE CUTTERS. NOW, WHERE ARE WE?
Lana: WE'RE AT YOU JUST SHOT THE GUY WHO COULD DISARM THE BOMB, JACKASS!
Archer: I DIDN'T SHOOT HIM! YOU THINK I'D BRING A GUN ON THIS FIRETRAP?
Lana: WELL, THEN WHO DID IT?  I DID!
Lana: CAPTAIN LAMMERS?!
Archer: NICE READ, VELMA. "KEEP YOUR 401(k) IN COMPANY STOCK," THEY SAID. "THE PRICE CAN ONLY GO UP," THEY SAID. WELL, GUESS WHAT.
Archer: UM, IT DIDN'T? WHO THE HELL WANTS A TWO-DAY BLIMP RIDE TO LONDON, WHICH IS OUR ONLY ROUTE?!
Archer: OKAY, SO IT'S A NICHE MARKET, BUT --
Lana: BLOWING IT UP WILL SEND THE STOCK PRICE DOWN TO ZERO! YEAH, THAT'S WHY I SHORTED IT.
Lana: BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL THE OTHER EMPLOYEES? UM...
Lana: SEE, IT'S THAT KIND OF SELFISH SHIT --
Archer: LANA, NO! YOU'LL KILL US ALL! FOR THE LAST TIME, YOU IDIOT! IT'S NOT HYDROGEN! IT'S HELIU-U-U-U-M!
Lana: AND WHAT ABOUT THAT ARE YOU STILL NOT GETTING, EXACTLY?
Archer: WELL, OBVIOUSLY THE CORE CONCEPT, LANA. SORRY I DIDN'T GO TO SPACE CAMP.
Lana: HOW ABOUT BOMB-DEFUSAL CAMP?
Archer: NO, ACTUALLY, LACROSSE CAMP, IF THAT HELPS. I MEAN, A LOT OF THOSE SKILLS ARE UNIVERSAL.
Lana: SHUT UP. AGENT GILLETTE, PLEASE.
Archer: OH, GREAT. COME ON, PEOPLE, TALK TO ME! WHAT ARE WE THINKING? WHAT ARE WE DOING? WHAT ARE WE WEARING? MY CRISIS VEST, MR. FAT FACE. LANA? HEY, GIRL. YOU THERE?
Lana: YEAH, I'M -- HEY, CAN YOU SEE ME? I SEE YOUR KNOCKOFF FIACCI DRAWERS!
Lana: YOU ARE SUCH A BITCH.
Archer: HEY, RAY. UGH! LET'S SEE THAT IGNITION, GIRL.
Lana: GOT IT? EAST GERMAN CRAP. PROBABLY A GK-31 OR -32.
Archer: SO, UH... SO ON THE SIDE OF THE TIMER, THERE SHOULD BE A SERIAL NUMBER. THAT'LL TELL ME WHICH WIRE Y'ALL NEED TO CUT.
Archer: ALL RIGHT, UH...
Lana: YOU GOT IT?
Archer: YEAH, I SEE IT. READY? SINCE FIRST CALL.
Archer: 9-3-4... [ STATIC ] ...T-X-S... T-X-X? TWO X's?
Archer: NO, X-S, LIKE INXS. IN-X-X?
Archer: "S"! JESUS, USE THE NATO PHONETIC ALPHABET.
Archer: WHAT?
Lana: CHRIST ON SALE! IS IT "S"?
Archer: DUH!
Lana: "SIERRA." RAY, IT'S NINER-3-4... TANGO-XRAY-SIERRA. THANK YOU, DOLL. NOW, THERE SHOULD BE A DASH FOLLOWED BY TWO LETTERS.
Archer: OKAY. OKAY, SO NOW I WANT YOU TO CUT THE BLUE AND WHITE WIRE.
Archer: WHICH ONE? THERE'S TWO OF THOSE. NO -- ONE'S BLUE WITH A WHITE STRIPE, AND THE OTHER ONE'S WHITE WITH A BLUE STRIPE.
Archer: YEAH, AND BOTH ARE IDENTICAL! NO! THEY'RE NOT!
Lana: UH, RAY, HON? THEY'RE REALLY SIMILAR. ONE'S A TEENY BIT...BLUE, HONEY.
Archer: WHICH ONE?
Lana: I GUESS THAT ONE MAYBE.
Archer: SO, WAIT, WHICH ONE DO I CUT? THE TEENY BIT...BLUE ONE!
Archer: OKAY! OKAY! WAIT! STOP! YOU SAID THE TWO LETTERS AFTER THE DASH WERE OSCAR-KILO.
Archer: WHO?
Lana: WHAT? "OK" -- OSCAR-KILO.
Archer: NO! "OKAY"! LIKE, "OKAY, NOW I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHAT THEY ARE." YEAH, AND THEN YOU DIDN'T.
Archer: I THOUGHT WE SKIPPED THAT PART! SKIPPED A STEP IN DISARMING A BOMB.
Archer: YEAH, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS PRETTY IRRESPONSIBLE ON YOUR PART!
Lana: WHY DO YOU ALWAYS DO THIS?!
Archer: WHY DO YOU ALWAYS NOT SHUT UP?! [ FEEDBACK ]
Both: OW.
Archer: STOP. ON THE RADIO, WHEN WE ANSWER IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, WE SAY "ROGER."
Archer: O-- ROGER. SORRY. NOW, IN THE SERIAL NUMBER, WHAT ARE THE TWO LETTERS FOLLOWING THE DASH? [ BEEPING CONTINUES ]
Archer: YOU READY? ROGER!
Archer: THE FIRST LETTER IS "B." "BRAVO."
Archer: THANKS. SECOND LETTER IS "N." "M" AS IN "MIKE" OR "N" AS --
Archer: AS IN "NANCY." GOD. YOU OF ALL PEOPLE WHAT?! ME OF ALL PEOPLE WHAT?
Archer: NOTHING. MM-HMM.
Lana: RAY, HON? OKAY, SO --
Archer: YOU CAN SAY "OKAY." OH, MY GOD!
Lana: RAY, CAN I SHOOT HIM? IN ABOUT FIVE SECONDS, HONEY. [ GUN COCKS ]
Archer: LANA, BE CAREFUL! JESUS, THE HELIUM! RIGHT AFTER HE CUTS THE SOLID-GREEN WIRE.
Archer: THE GREEN COLOR IS SOLID OR -- ROGER!
Archer: O-- ROGER. CUTTING THE GREEN WIRE. [ BEEPING CONTINUES ] ARCHER!
Archer: JESUS! GOD! WHAT?! THAT'S HOW ANNOYING YOU ARE.
Archer: YOUR MOM'S ANNOYING! HOW ABOUT THAT? LET'S GO THERE.
Lana: LET'S GO HERE, WHERE, ARCHER, SHUT UP AND CUT THE GODDAMN WIRE, ALREADY!
Archer: YOU SHUT UP, AND I'M DOING IT! GOD! [ RAPID BEEPING ]
Lana: OH, MY -- RAY! WHAT'S GOING ON?
Lana: THE TIMER SPED UP! DID YOU CUT THE GREEN ONE?!
Archer: YES! ROGER! STEVEN! WHOEVER!
Lana: RAY? WHAT WERE THE LAST TWO LETTERS?!
Archer: "B," AS IN "BUTT HOLE"!
Lana: WHAT DO WE DO HERE?
Archer: AND "M," AS IN "MANCY." WHAT?!
Lana: [ CLEARS THROAT ] "M" AS IN WHAT?
Archer: "MANCY." WHAT DID YOU THINK I SAID? "NANCY"!
Archer: OH. YOU IDIOT!
Archer: I CAN SEE HOW, UH... AND THEN I WAS LIKE, "YOU OF ALL --" [ GUNSHOT ]
Archer: [ SCREAMS ] AAH! AAH! OW! EXACT SAME SPOT!
Lana: RAY? RAY, TELL ME WHAT TO DO! OOH. DO Y'ALL HAVE PARACHUTES?
Lana: NO! WELL, THAT WOULD BE, YOU KNOW -- PROBLEM SOLVED!
Lana: RAY! I DON'T KNOW! PUSH IT OFF WITH YOUR BIG-ASS HANDS!
Lana: [ GRUNTING ] GOOD LUCK, HONEY.
Lana: [ Straining ] OH, IT'S TOO HEAVY! ARCHER!
Archer: OW! AAH! AAH!
Lana: I CANNOT DO THIS ALONE!
Cyril: YOU'RE NOT ALONE! Lana: [ GASPS ] BABY! YOU CAME BACK TO ME!
Cyril: WELL, I REALLY -- LANA, THERE'S A LOT YOU AND I NEED TO TALK ABOUT.
Lana: AND LET'S DO THAT, RIGHT AFTER WE SHOVE THIS HUGE BOMB OFF THE BLIMP.
Cyril: OKAY, BUT THEN WE SERIOUSLY NEED TO --
Lana: CYRIL! Cyril: SORRY. HERE WE GO. [ BOTH GRUNTING ] LANA, WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT!
Lana: YES, WE ARE, CYRIL! WE ARE GONNA MAKE IT! [ BOTH GRUNT ]
Cyril: HA!
Lana: WHOO!
Cyril: OH, MY GOD! LANA, WE MADE IT!
Archer: HOORAY FOR METAPHORS!
Lana: I TOLD YOU. [ LAUGHS ] OKAY, NOW, THEN, WHAT DID YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT?
Cyril: UM, WELL, UH, A LOT OF STUFF, REALLY. [ EXPLOSION ] STARTING WITH THE FACT WE JUST BOMBED IRELAND.
Lana: UM...PRETTY SURE THAT'S WALES.
