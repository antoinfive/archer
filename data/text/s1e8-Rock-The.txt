[ BOOTS THUMP ]
Archer: Shh! [ CROSSBOW SPRINGS ] [ TILES CRACK ] Shh! * MULATTO BUTT * MULATTO BUTT [ CELLPHONE BEEPS ]
Lana: Ohh, why the hell is your phone on?
Archer: Because I have a social life! YELLO?
Malory: WHY THE HELL IS YOUR PHONE ON?
Archer: BECAUSE I HAVE -- WHY DID YOU CALL?
Malory: BECAUSE THIS IS IMPORTANT.
Archer: MICROMANAGITIS.
Malory: IF WE SHOW SAN MARINO THE FLAWS IN THEIR PALACE SECURITY, THEY'VE AGREED TO HIRE US AS SECURITY CONSULTANTS. AND I'M SURE I DON'T NEED TO REMIND YOU THAT WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN ONE OF THESE JOBS SINCE YOUR UFFIZI FIASCO. [ SIREN WAILING ] [ GLASS SHATTERS ]
Archer: AND YET, YOU ALWAYS DO.
Malory: BECAUSE YOU LEARNED NOTHING FROM IT.
Archer: I LEARNED THAT "FLAMMABLE" AND "INFLAMMABLE" MEAN THE SAME THING.
Lana: WAIT, WHAT?
Malory: WELL, THIS TIME MAKE SURE YOU --
Archer: MOTHER! OH, MY GOD! WE'VE BEEN SPOTTED, AND THEY'RE SHOOTING AT US! OH, MY! OH, GOD! [ CELLPHONE BEEPS ] BET SHE'S FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW.
Malory: OH, MY GOD! WHAT SHADE IS THAT -- CRACK-WHORE RED?
Lana: YOU SAID THEY WERE TRANQUILIZER DARTS!
Archer: AH, I MERELY IMPLIED THAT.
Lana: DAMN IT! SO I POISONED LIKE FIVE INNOCENT SECURITY GUARDS?
Archer: WOULD YOU RELAX? I'M PRETTY SURE SAN MARINO HAS UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE.
Lana: SO?
Archer: SO, THAT'S GOOD FOR THEM 'CAUSE THERE'S GONNA BE SOME NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE.
Lana: OHH!
Archer: OH, MY.
Lana: WOW.
Archer: LANA. Lana: THAT IS ONE SERIOUS DIAMOND.
Pam: [ Slurring ] BUT IS IT SUPPOSED TO BE BROWN?
Cyril: IT'S NOT BROWN, PAM.
Pam: [ BELCHES ]
Cyril: THAT COLOR IS CALLED "CHAMPAGNE."
Pam: MM-HMM, AND WHY DO YOU HAVE IT?
Cyril: BECAUSE I...AM GONNA ASK LANA TO MARRY ME.
Pam: AND YOU'RE GONNA GIVE HER THAT IF SHE SAYS NO?
Cyril: HEY!
Pam: LIKE A BIG "SCREW YOU AND YOUR BIG LINCOLN LOG-Y FINGERS"? [ BELCHES ]
Archer: SO, THE LAST THING YOU HEAR ME SAY IS, "OH, MY GOD! THEY'RE SHOOTING AT US!" AND YOU DON'T EVEN CALL ME BACK?
Malory: WELL, I KNEW YOU WEREN'T IN ANY REAL DANGER -- YOU KNOW, WITH LANA THERE.
- Lana: HA! - Archer: HA!
Malory: AND LET'S JUST KNOCK OFF THE GIGGLING. I WANT GAME FACES ON THOSE HEADS FOR OUR CONFERENCE CALL WITH THE PRINCE.
Lana: I THOUGHT HE WAS A CAPTAIN REGENT.
Malory: OH, WHATEVER. ALL OF SAN MARINO COULD FIT IN THE SOUTH BRONX. THE IMPORTANT THING IS, THEY'RE LOADED.
Pam: [ Laughing ] JUST SHITFACED!
Cyril: [ GROANS ]
Pam: ABOUT 15 FREAKIN' BEERS, ALL THAT SCHUETZIE, AND -- HOLY SHIT! -- DID I HONK DOWN A BUNCH OF ABSINTHE?
Cyril: I DON'T KNOW, PAM, BUT COULD YOU LOWER YOUR VOICE?
Pam: I MUST HAVE, 'CAUSE I HALLUCINATED YOU HAD AN ENGAGEMENT RI--
Cyril: Not...another...word! AND JUST WHAT IS THIS, I ASK YOU?
Cyril: HELLO, CHERYL.
Pam: WHAT THE -- CYRIL, ARE YOU CHEATING ON ME?
Cyril: NO, JUST TRYING TO GET MY MUFFIN BACK. UH, NO, YOU'RE NOT!
Cyril: I'M NOT? NOT LIKE THAT. YOU GOT TO SLUG HER IN THE DIAPHRAGM WITH A FOREARM SHIVER!
Cyril: OH. THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW. [ CHUCKLES ]
- DO IT! - Cyril: UM...
Pam: UGH! [ THUDS ] [ VOMITING ]
Cyril: WOW. AND NO MUFFIN. SEE? TIME LOST IS MUFFIN LOST, ALONG WITH MY APPETITE -- FOR FOOD, THAT IS. OOH.
Cyril: UGH! COME SEE ME.
Cyril: WOW, I AM INCREDIBLY SORRY.
Claudio: BUT THAT IS MY DECISION, MS. ARCHER. AND AS CAPTAIN REGENT OF SAN --
Malory: I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE CAPTAIN...
Archer: CRUNCH! NO, WAIT, BEEFHEART.
Malory: CLAUDIO, WE HAD A DEAL.
Archer: NO, WAIT -- KANGAROO.
Lana: AND WE POINTED OUT EVERY SINGLE FLAW IN YOUR CUT-RATE SECURITY SYSTEM.
Malory: AND NOW NOT ONLY ARE YOU HIRING ANOTHER AGENCY...
Archer: THERE WAS A CAPTAIN KANGAROO.
Malory: ...YOU WON'T EVEN PAY ISIS FOR THAT SECURITY PROBE!
Lana: WHICH MEANS NO BONUSES FOR US.
Archer: WAIT, WHAT?
Malory: OH, NOW HE CARES.
Claudio: THOSE MONIES WILL GO TO MEDICAL CARE FOR THE PALACE GUARDS THEY POISONED.
Malory: WHAT?
Archer: LANA DID THAT!
Lana: I --
Claudio: AND AS FOR HIRING ODIN --
Malory: ODIN?!
Trexler: UH, SKIPPER, IF I COULD JUMP IN HERE...
Malory: TREXLER! Trexler: OH, MALORY. EVEN ON -- WHAT IS THIS, 1080p? -- YOU LOOK JUST AS SUPPLE AND SEXY AS THE DAY I FIRST LAID EYES ON YOU.
Archer: WHERE? IN A WAX MUSEUM?
Trexler: STERLING, THAT'S NO WAY TO TALK TO YOUR MOTHER.
Malory: AND JUST WHO IN THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? GETTING ISIS BLACKLISTED AT THE U.N.?
Trexler: HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT.
Malory: EMBARRASSING ME IN BERLIN?
Trexler: THE ENTIRE HOTEL WAS EMBARRASSED.
Malory: STEALING ALL MY PROSPECTIVE CLIENTS?
Trexler: N-- YEAH.
Malory: AND NO MATTER WHICH WAY I TURN, YOU'RE BUTTING IN THAT BIG, FAT, STRONG, AQUILINE NOSE OF YOURS.
Archer: WAIT. WHAT?
Trexler: YOU SAID IT WAS THE NOSE OF A CAESAR.
Claudio: ENH.
Malory: WELL, PERHAPS A LESSER CAESAR.
Trexler: NO, NO. NOW, I CLEARLY REMEMBER YOU SAID "AUGUSTUS" AND "IN VINO VERITAS."
Malory: AND THE CHIANTI WAS DEFINITELY FLOWING... AMONG OTHER THINGS.
Archer: MOTHER!
Malory: HMM? OH, UH, THIS IS THE LAST TIME YOU MAKE ME OUT A FOOL, LEN TREXLER! YOU WANT TO PLAY ME HARD?
- Archer: PHRASING. - Trexler: YOU HAVE NO IDEA.
Malory: THEN YOU BETTER NUT UP.
- Archer: PHRASING. - Malory: ...BECAUSE I'VE SWALLOWED JUST ABOUT AS MUCH AS I CAN TAKE FROM YOU!
Archer: HEY! PHRASING!
Malory: ...AND WE'LL SEE WHO'S SMIRKING WHEN ISIS STEALS THAT DIAMOND FOR REAL!
Trexler: [ INHALES SHARPLY ] OOH, YOU'RE A NAUGHTY GIRL.
Malory: RIGHT, THEN! COMMENCE OPERATION "RUB LEN TREXLER'S BIG FAT NOSE IN IT!"
Archer: UGH. SOUNDS LIKE YOU ALREADY HAVE.
Lana: WAIT. YOU WANT US TO BREAK BACK INTO THE PALACE, WHICH NOW HAS THE INSANE AMOUNT OF SECURITY WE RECOMMENDED, PLUS GOD KNOWS HOW MANY ODIN GUYS...
Malory: YES, SO TAKE MORE OF THAT POISON.
Lana: ...AND ON TOP OF THAT SUCK SALAD, YOU WANT TO SPRINKLE ON THE BACON BITS OF, "OH, HEY, LET'S TELL THEM WE'RE COMING"?!
Malory: WELL?
Lana: WELL, THERE'S THIS NEW THING CALLED THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE?
Cyril: I'M SO SORRY I SLAMMED YOU IN THE GUT. GEEZ, THAT'S HOW HOUDINI DIED.
Pam: HOUDINI DIED OF AIDS.
Cyril: NO! WHY DO YOU ALWAYS SAY THAT? AND THAT'S THE THING -- I WANT TO SURPRISE LANA.
Pam: WELL, YOU NAILED IT.
Cyril: SO, THIS TIME, I NEED YOU TO NOT BE YOUR NORMAL, COMPULSIVELY BLABBY SELF.
Pam: W-WHEN HAVE I EVER BEEN BLABBY?
Jane: [ CRYING ]
Pam: [ Singsong voice ] GUESS WHO HAS BREAST CANCER.
Jane: [ SOBS ]
Cyril: JUST ONE OF LIKE TWO DOZEN EQUALLY APPALLING VIDEOS ON YOUR WEBSITE.
Pam: THEY'RE NOT ALL EQUALLY APP-- OHH, AND HAVE I BLABBED ABOUT YOU AND CHERYL?
Cyril: SHE KEEPS SEDUCING ME!
Pam: AND YOU THINK YOU CAN MAKE THAT UNHAPPEN IF YOU GIVE LANA A TINY FLAKE OF BROWN MICA? CYRIL, LOOK AT IT!
Cyril: BUT I SPENT TWO MONTHS' SALARY.
Pam: I KNOW, BUT YOU MAKE SHIT.
Cyril: HEY, I'M DOING PRETTY WELL, THANK YOU.
Pam: SAVE THE SPEECH FOR THE FATHER YOU CONTINUALLY DISAPPOINT. I'M HEAD OF H.R., CYRIL. I KNOW YOUR TAKE-HOME.
Cyril: YEAH, AND I -- I -- I TAKE HOME SHIT!
Pam: WELL, WE ALL DO.
Cyril: BUT WHAT'S MY FATHER EVER DONE THAT'S SO GREAT -- SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT?! BIG WHOOP! THERE'S ONLY LIKE 800 KIDS IN THE ENTIRE COUNTY, "K" THROUGH 12!
Pam: WOW.
Cyril: I'M SORRY. UH, YOU WERE SAYING?
Pam: I WERE SAYING, WE ALL MAKE SHIT, SO WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS UNIONIZE!
Cyril: YEAH! I'LL GET THE RAISE I DESERVE.
Pam: THEN YOU CAN BUY LANA A BIG-BOY RING.
Cyril: SHE'LL PROMPTLY AGREE TO MARRY ME.
Pam: THEN YOU CAN TAKE HER HOME TO MEET YOUR DICK DAD.
Cyril: AND THEN I SHOVE HIS HAWK FACE RIGHT INTO HER BIG BROWN BOOBS AND SCREAM, "LOOK AT THESE BABIES, OLD MAN! DIDN'T NEED A VARSITY LETTER TO GET THOSE, DID I?! SO NOW WHO'S A DISAPPOINTMENT?!" OH, JESUS H. JONES, PAM.
Pam: WHAT?
Malory: CAROL? CAROL? OH, WAIT. CHERYL? CHERYL? HELLO? CHERYL, I SWEAR TO GOD, IF I HAVE TO OPEN MY OWN SALAD AGAIN, I WILL FREAK OUT! W-WHERE THE HELL IS EVERYBODY?
Lana: SO, LET'S ASSUME WE CAN'T ACCESS THE PALACE THROUGH THAT SAME SKYLIGHT.
Archer: OKAY.
Lana: BUT MAYBE WE OVERLOOKED AN AIR SHAFT, OR MAYBE EVEN SOME ACCESS BELOW GRADE.
Archer: UH.
Lana: SO LET'S PULL UP THE PALACE SCHEMATICS.
Archer: UM, OKAY.
Lana: MAYBE TODAY...
Archer: HANG ON. Lana: ...IF THAT WORKS FOR YOU.
Archer: UM, LET ME SEE. HOW ABOUT NOW? ANYTHING?
Lana: NO.
Archer: UH, HOW ABOUT NOW? Lana: NO.
Archer: HOW ABOUT NOW?
Lana: NO. WHAT ARE YOU DOING BACK THERE?
Archer: I DON'T KNOW! Lana: WHAT ARE YOU -- JUST HITTING RANDOM KEYS?
Archer: WELL, OBVIOUSLY!
Lana: OHH, DAMN IT, WE -- WHERE'S THE HOBBIT GUY?
Archer: [ LAUGHS ] A FRICKIN' HOBBIT WORKS HERE?
Lana: NO, HE'S JUST A --
Archer: LANA, THEY'RE CALLED "LITTLE PEOPLE," NOT "HOBBITS."
Lana: WILL YOU -- HE'S A HOBBIT ENTHUSIAST.
Archer: EW.
Lana: YEAH, BUT HE ALSO KNOWS HOW TO WORK ALL THE COMPUTERS AND SATELLITES AND SHIT.
Bilbo: BUT EVEN THOUGH I DO ALL THAT, I GOT TO LIVE WITH A ROOMMATE IN QUEENS. [ CROWD MURMURS ]
Pam: ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW UNDERPAID THE ISIS SUPPORT STAFF REALLY IS. AND I, FOR ONE, AM FED UP! YEAH, FED FULL OF MUFFINS AND DENIAL.
Pam: WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, NECK BONES? MY PROBLEM IS, I REMEMBER WHAT MS. ARCHER DID TO THE CLEANING LADIES! YOU SURE, MISSUS? IS PLENTY OF SPACE.
Malory: NO, GRACIAS. OKAY. [ MACHINERY WHIRS ] [ CABLE SNAPS ] AAH! [ CRASHES ]
Malory: HA! HOW'S THAT FOR BREAD AND ROSES? OH, MY GOODNESS.
Pam: YEAH, THAT WAS PRETTY SAD. WHAT'S SAD IS NOW NOBODY RESTOCKS THE STUPID MACHINE IN THE BATHROOM, SO I HAVE TO MAKE MY OWN TAMPONS. TAMPONS? WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. EXACTLY, AND SO I SAY NO UNION. YEAH!
Pam: NO, NO, NO, WAIT. HUNH-UNH. DON'T LISTEN TO THE "MAKES HER OWN TAMPONS" PERSON!
Cyril: LISTEN TO YOUR HEARTS BECAUSE DEEP DOWN YOU KNOW THEY'RE EXPLOITING US. BUT IF WE UNITE, WE CAN PUT A STOP TO IT. AND THAT SUPPLY CLOSET IS JUST PACKED WITH POSTER BOARD AND MARKERS AND MAYBE EVEN SOME GLITTER! SO, WHO'S WITH ME ON THE PICKET LINE?! [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] AND ME!
Cyril: REALLY? YOU HAD ME AT "PUT."
Lana: YES, WE NEED A SOUND SENSOR. DUH! GOD, WHERE IS THAT EQUIPMENT GUY? AND WHERE THE HELL ARE THE JUMARS?
Archer: YEAH, I DON'T KNOW. THIS WAS ALL I COULD FIND. I'M THINKING GOGGLES -- YES. SHOVELS -- I DON'T KNOW HOW OR WHY WE'D USE 'EM.
Lana: OHH!
Malory: CHERYL!
Lana: SHE'S NOT IN HERE!
Malory: WHY ARE YOU IN HERE? IS THE SAN MARINO DIAMOND IN HERE NOW?
Archer: IT MIGHT BE, FOR ALL WE KNOW.
Lana: WE CAN'T FIND ANY OF THE GEAR WE NEED, WE'VE GOT NO SATCOMs, NO NEW INTEL, AND SO, BASICALLY, WE ARE TOTALLY UNPREPARED FOR THIS MISSION!
Archer: UNLESS IT INVOLVES NIGHT-SHOVELING.
Malory: WELL, I WANT THAT DIAMOND, NOT TO MENTION MY "RAPIDLY APPROACHING ROOM TEMPERATURE" COBB SALAD, SO -- DAMN IT. WHERE THE HELL ARE ALL THE DRONES? WHAT DO WE WANT?
All: UNFAIR! WHEN DO WE WANT IT?
All: CHANGE!
Cyril: OKAY, SO THEY'RE BAD CHANTERS, BUT OVERALL, THIS STRIKE'S SHAPING UP.
Pam: HOW? NOBODY KNOWS WHY WE'RE STRIKING.
Cyril: WELL, WE CAN'T SAY, "HEY, RIGHT UPSTAIRS IS A TOP SECRET INTELLIGENCE AGENCY."
Pam: BUT IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE PICKETING THE CLEANERS!
Cyril: NO, IT DOESN'T.
Pam: JESUS! STOP PICKETING THE CLEANERS!
Pam: YOU WERE SAYING?
Lana: WHY ARE PEOPLE PICKETING THE CLEANERS?
Archer: I PREDICTED THIS. IT'S CURRY FURY.
Lana: HOLY SHIT. IS THAT CYRIL?
Archer: AND PAM, KRIEGER, CAROL, ALL THE...
Malory: DRONES! THEY'RE NOT PICKETING THE CLEANERS -- THEY'RE PICKETING ISIS!
Lana: WHAT'S THEIR BEEF?
Malory: OH, THE SAME ENTITLED CRAP AS ALWAYS -- "I CAN'T MAKE ENDS MEET." "I'M ON FOOD STAMPS." "MY CHILD DIED BECAUSE I COULDN'T AFFORD NEW BONE MARROW" -- JUST, "ME, ME, ME, ME, ME!"
Lana: JESUS, WHOSE KID DIED?
Malory: OH, WHO REMEMBERS? CHECK PAM'S BLOG.
Archer: AND DONE, BUT IF YOU STILL WANT US TO STEAL YOU THAT GIGANTIC DIAMOND...
Malory: WELL, OBVIOUSLY.
Archer: ...WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CROSS THEIR PICKET LINE. [ GLASS SHATTERING ]
Lana: WELL, SCREW THAT.
Archer: YEAH, WHAT'S WITH ALL THE BOTTLES? IT'S LIKE A TRAILER-PARK EASTER. LOUSY COMMIES! GO BACK TO QUEBEC!
Pam: JESUS! OKAY, STRIKE'S OVER, EVERYBODY.
Cyril: NO, HOLD THAT LINE. WE DESERVE A RAISE, AND LANA DESERVES A REAL RING, SO -- AAH!
Archer: OKAY, SO, LET'S GO OUT THE BACK. [ BELL RINGS ]
Lana: OH, MY GOD!
Archer: [ LAUGHS ] HAPPY EASTER, CYRIL.
Cyril: LANA.
Lana: OH, BABY, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
Cyril: WELL, SEE, I WANTED TO BUY YOU A --
Pam: CYRIL, THIS IS NOT THAT MOMENT.
Krieger: AND WE DON'T TALK TO MANAGEMENT. OR HAM-FISTED WHORES.
Lana: WHAT? HMM?
Cyril: YEAH, NO, THEY'RE RIGHT.
- Lana: WHAT?! - Cyril: NO, NOT THE WHORE PART -- MANAGEMENT.
Lana: BUT WE'RE NOT TECHNICALLY MANAGEMENT.
Pam: BUT YOU MAKE SHITLOADS MORE THAN WE DO.
Krieger: EVEN THOUGH YOU TOTALLY DEPEND ON US.
Archer: ON YOU? HEY, WE'RE OUT THERE RISKING OUR LIVES EVERY -- MANY OF THE DAYS!
Lana: AND SO, YES, WE GET PAID A LITTLE MORE.
Cyril: HOW MUCH A LITTLE MORE?
Lana: WELL, IT'S COMPLICATED...
Archer: NO, IT ISN'T. DON'T ANSWER THAT! Lana: ...WHAT WITH SALARY AND PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES AND ALL THE BONUSES.
Cyril: BONUSES?! DUMP HER, CYRIL!
Lana: HEY, CRAZY, GO MACRAME SOME TAMPONS! OH, YOU WANT TO HEAR SOMETHING CRAZY? CYRIL --
Cyril: THANK YOU, PAM. NOW LOOK, LANA --
Lana: BABY, "TAKE CHARGE CYRIL" IS TOTALLY DOING IT FOR ME. IT REALLY IS, BUT WE'RE ON A VITAL MISSION HERE.
Pam: VITAL MISSION?
Bilbo: NOT ON THE MASTER CLIPBOARD.
Cyril: SO, JUST HOW VITAL IS IT?
Malory: IT'S INCREDIBLY VITAL BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T STEAL ME THAT HUGE DIAMOND, I WILL LITERALLY DIE.
Pam: A DIAMOND? IN THIS ECONOMY?
Cyril: YOU'RE STEALING A DIAMOND FOR HER?
Pam: OH, IRONY.
Malory: AND THE REST OF YOU, BACK TO WORK! IF THAT SALAD ISN'T OPEN IN -- GET 'EM! [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ]
Malory: OH! OH!
Lana: HEY, HEY, WHOA!
Archer: STOP SURGING! Lana: ARCHER, DO SOMETHING!
Archer: I AM DOING SOMETHING! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
All: [ COUGHING ]
Archer: LANA, OUT THE BACK! MOVE! HEY, CYRIL! CYRIL! CYRIL!!
Cyril: WHAT?!
Archer: I'M SAVING LANA, AS USUAL!
Cyril: HEY, SHUT UP!
Archer: FRICKIN' ODIN. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
Lana: HOW MANY ARE THERE?
Archer: ABOUT A JILLION.
Lana: DAMN IT.
Archer: A JILLION GAY LITTLE COPYCATS.
Lana: WHAT?
Archer: I MEAN, I DIDN'T INVENT THE TURTLENECK, LANA, BUT I WAS THE FIRST TO RECOGNIZE ITS POTENTIAL AS A TACTICAL GARMENT.
Lana: OHH.
Archer: THE TACTICAL TURTLENECK, LANA.
Lana: ARCHER.
Archer: THE "TACTLENECK."
Lana: CAN YOU PLEASE FOCUS?
Archer: NOT REALLY. I DON'T THINK THESE GOGGLES WERE PROPERLY CALIBRATED.
Lana: DITTO THE SOUND SENSOR AND THE STUPID CODE CLONER -- ALL THE GEAR THOSE SWEATY TECH DWEEBS NORMALLY -- [ GASPS ] DO WE TAKE THE DRONES FOR GRANTED?
Archer: NO, NO, NO, LANA. DO NOT MAKE THIS ABOUT THEM.
Malory: NO, NO, NO. THAT IS UTTERLY UNACCEPTABLE.
Cyril: IT'S JUST A COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT.
Malory: IT'S STRONG-ARM ROBBERY!
Pam: COME ON, MS. ARCHER. YOU'VE BEEN IN THERE 10 HOURS. MEET US HALFWAY, AND KRIEGER WILL LET YOU OUT OF THERE.
Krieger: OR ELSE HE'LL CRANK UP THE HEAT AGAIN! I LOVE THAT YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THAT.
Krieger: AND I LOVE THAT I HAVE AN ERECTION THAT DIDN'T INVOLVE HOMELESS PEOPLE.
Pam: AND YOU'RE COOL WITH KRIEGER SHUCKIN' YOUR SIDE CORN?
Cyril: YEAH, THAT IS A HUGE WIN-WIN FOR ME.
Pam: YOU HEAR THAT, MS. ARCHER? WE'RE ALL ON BOARD FOR THE BIG WIN-WIN OUT HERE!
Malory: WELL, I'M NOT! DO YOUR WORST, KRIEGER!
Krieger: OKAY. OH, MY GOD, YES!
Malory: YES, GO AHEAD! CRANK UP THE HEAT! I'M AS NAKED AS THE DAY I WAS BORN!
Pam: OH, EW. AND THAT IS NOT SO GREAT.
Pam: NAKED OR NOT...
Cyril: DON'T KEEP SAYING IT.
Pam: ...YOU CAN'T STAY IN THERE FOREVER.
Malory: HA! I'LL OUTLAST YOU! I'M NAKED, AND I'VE GOT HALF A LIME AND ALMOST... [ INHALES SHARPLY ] NEARLY 2/3 OF A HALF-GALLON OF -- [ GLASS SHATTERS ] SHIT.
Cyril: HA!
Pam: NOW WE GOT HER!
Malory: HA! I'LL SUCK IT STRAIGHT OFF THIS GRIMY LINOLEUM BEFORE I GIVE IN TO YOU BELLYACHERS! YOU'VE GOT NOTHING!
Lana: NO CODE CLONER, NO GPS. UGH! WE'VE GOT NO THERMAL IMAGING!
Archer: LANA, WE DON'T NEED GADGETS.
Lana: OH, REALLY?
Archer: MACHINES ARE GONNA FAIL. THEN THE SYSTEM'S GONNA FAIL. AND THEN IT'S "WHO HAS THE ABILITY TO SURVIVE?" AND THAT'S THE GAME, LANA -- SURVIVAL.
Lana: JUST WATCHED "DELIVERANCE" AGAIN, HUH?
Archer: I MEAN, IS BURT REYNOLDS NOT THE MAN IN THAT? ON THE RAFT... WITH THE VEST, HUH?
Lana: [ SIGHS ]
Archer: HE DID HIS OWN STUNTS.
- Lana: I KNOW! - Archer: Shh!
Lana: HE DID HIS OWN STUNTS!
Archer: Keep your frickin' voice -- AAH! GOD! SWEET JESUS, THE GOGGLES! INTRUDERS! GET THEM! [ SIREN WAILING, GUNFIRE ]
Archer: AAH, LANA!
- LANA, I'M BLIND! - Lana: YEAH?
Archer: I'M BLIND!
Lana: SHOULD I GO ON WITHOUT YOU?
Archer: WHAT? NO, CARRY ME, MONSTER-HANDS! [ WAILING CONTINUES ]
Archer: OW! OW! OW! JESUS! QUIT BOUNCING MY EYES!
Lana: SHUT UP! I'M TRYING TO GET US AN EVAC, BUT NOBODY'S ANSWER-- OH, HOLY SHIT, ARE THEY STILL ON STRIKE?
Archer: HEY, EUGENE DEBS, IT'S ONLY BEEN ABOUT 10 HOURS, ALL RIGHT?
Cyril: SO YOU'D RATHER DIE IN THERE THAN GIVE US A COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT?
Malory: YES!
Krieger: I CAN ARRANGE THAT. CRUNCH! I LOVE THAT YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THAT.
Pam: WELL, NOW YOU'RE TRAPPED. [ TELEPHONE RINGING ] HAPPY?
Malory: YES!
Pam: AH! LAUNDRY. OH, WAIT, ARE WE OPEN? WHAT? SIR, YOU HAVE TO SLOW -- GEEZY PETES, GET A LOAD OF THIS GUY.
Lana: WE'RE TAKING HEAVY FIRE, AND WE NEED A FRICKIN' EXTRACTION, YOU DUMBASS!
All: [ GASP ]
Cyril: LANA!
Archer: [ LAUGHS ] SHE THOUGHT YOU WERE A MAN.
Lana: SHUT UP! CYRIL, BABY, WE'RE PINNED DOWN, OKAY? WE NEED A -- AAH!
Cyril: LANA!
Malory: WHAT'S GOING ON?
Lana: WE NEED EVAC -- A HELO, A JUMP JET --
Archer: UH, AT THIS POINT, REALLY ANYTHING.
Malory: WELL, DON'T JUST STAND THERE, IDIOTS!
Cyril: YEAH, COME ON! GET 'EM OUT OF THERE! Bilbo: UH, YOU'D NEED THE SATCOM LINK TO DO THAT.
Cyril: SO?
Bilbo: SO IT'S UPSTAIRS.
Krieger: AND, UH... SOMEONE BROKE THE ELEVATOR.
Pam: AND MISS FIRE HAZARD IN THERE BRICKED UP THE ONLY STAIRWELL!
Malory: DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT FIRE HAZARDS. ALL YOU PEOPLE DID IN THERE WAS SMOKE! [ GUNFIRE ]
Lana: AAH, GOD, I'M HIT!
Archer: LANA!
Cyril: WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE DO SOMETHING?!
Archer: LIKE WHAT, CYRIL? I'M BLIND!
Cyril: NO, US! HERE!
Archer: OH! Cyril: KRIEGER, BILBO, COME ON -- CAN'T YOU GUYS DO SOMETHING?
Krieger: WH-- NO! OH, WAIT, I MEANT "YES." [ BEEPING ]
Bilbo: ROGER THAT, ZEBRA TWO. STAND BY. HELO'S 10-4. HE JUST NEEDS YOU TO UPLOAD YOUR GPS COORDINATES INTO HIS H.U.D.
Krieger: WHICH I WILL DO WITH THESE CELLPHONES. [ BEEPS ]
Pam: HOLY SHIT. YOU GEEKS ARE BADASS.
Krieger: WELL, WE COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT AN ELECTRICAL INSULATOR, SO THANK CYRIL FOR THE TINY BROWN DIAMOND.
Lana: WHAT?
Archer: OH, WAIT. LANA, DID WE GET THE DIAMOND?
Lana: WHAT? NO. BUT, CYRIL, WHY DID YOU HAVE A DIAMOND?
Cyril: OH, UH, JUST MY EAR STUD, YOU KNOW, FROM COLLEGE.
Lana: REALLY?
Archer: CALLED IT.
Krieger: AND, AGAIN, YOU DO REALIZE IT'LL BE TOTALLY DESTROYED IN THE PROCESS?
Cyril: YES, JUST HURRY UP, PLEASE!
Krieger: OKAY, UPLOADING GPS COORDINATE-- WAIT A SECOND. [ GUNFIRE ]
Lana: DAMN IT! WE DON'T HAVE A SECOND!
Archer: LANA, I'M SURE WE HAVE ONE SECOND. BUT, SERIOUSLY, IT DOES SOUND LIKE WE'RE ABOUT TO BE OVERRUN.
Malory: GET MY SON OUT OF THERE! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU PEOPLE WAITING FOR?!
Krieger: A GODDAMN COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT!
Lana: WHAT?!
Pam: HEY, YEAH.
Cyril: NO, KRIEGER, THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR THIS.
Krieger: IT IS EXACTLY THE TIME. SO, WHAT'S IT GONNA BE, YOU HARPY? YOU EVER WANT TO SEE YOUR SON AGAIN?
Malory: NOT AT THE NUMBER YOU QUOTED ME.
Archer: MOTHER!
Cyril: THAT NUMBER IS PEGGED TO THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX!
Malory: WHERE -- THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CANADA? [ GUNFIRE ]
Lana: JESUS, TAKE IT OUT OF OUR BONUSES!
Archer: WHAT? MOTHER, NO, LISTEN TO ME. AAH! I'M HIT! I'M HIT, AND I'M BLIND.
Pam: JESUS, MS. ARCHER, YOUR CHILD IS DYING.
Malory: OH, ALL RIGHT. IF THEY'LL GIVE UP THEIR BONUSES...
Archer: MOTHER!
Malory: ...YOU CAN HAVE YOUR LOUSY COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Pam: SOMETHING GOOD'S HAPPENING!
Krieger: AND YOU CAN HAVE YOUR DICK SON BACK. [ BEEPING ] [ ELECTRICITY HUMMING ] WHOA!
Malory: WHAT'S GOING ON?
Archer: I HEAR A HELICOPTER!
Cyril: OH, YEAH! Archer: HOLY SHIT! MY OTHER SENSES ARE ALREADY HEIGHTENED!
Cyril: HEY, THIS TIME I SAVED LANA. BUT, OH, GOD, PAM, TWO MONTHS' SALARY.
Pam: CYRIL, YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE ON GOOD PUSSY.
Bilbo: ROGER THAT, ZEBRA TWO. HEY, THE HELO'S GOT 'EM! THEY'RE SAFE! HOORAY. WAY TO GO.
Malory: THEN GET ME OUT OF THIS SWEATBOX... [ LIGHT JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS ] BECAUSE I AM OFFICIALLY OUT OF GIN.
Lana: OH, COME ON, ARCHER. NOT NOW. I'M SERIOUS.
Archer: HEY, I'M SERIOUS. LOOK AT ME, SERIOUSLY, LANA. AND FORGET THE EYE BANDAGE, BUT THE HAIR, THE STRONG JAWLINE -- WHO DO I REMIND YOU OF?
- Lana: NOBODY. - Archer: SAY IT.
Lana: PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME DO THIS.
- Archer: SAY IT. - Lana: OHH.
Archer: SAY IT!
Lana: BURT REYNOLDS IN "DELIVERANCE."
Archer: NO, NOT IN "DELIVERANCE"... [ CHUCKLES ] IN "GATOR"!
Lana: OHH.
Archer: RIGHT? HOW CAN YOU NOT SEE THAT?
