GILLETTE: Not once, not ever has he volunteered for a dangerous mi ion, and now all of a sudden he's like "Let me go"? ! On a night jump in the freezin-a  cold to kill a Finnish double agent? Please. So I'm like "Yeah, let Archer go!" But she's like "Ray, it's your mi ion and that's final!" But why? Cause just between us gals and the C-130, I think she used to screw, ick, Nikolai Jakov, the head of the KGB! I know, right? ! And I think Archer wanted this mi ion so he could cro  into Ru ia cause he thinks Jakov might be his father! And y'all know me, I'm no go ip, but that's some scandalous-a  shit right there... What. Dukes.
ARCHER: Ray? If it's any consolation, you were right. Oh, and try not to be unconscious too long. It's super bad for you. Hey thanks guys. Just tell my mother I pulled a gun on you, all right. This is to share. Look at me! To share! You nut. O.K. Got my fake documents, plenty of cash, so the cro ing should be a breeze. Drive to Saint Pete, grab a latte, then 400 miles to Moscow... Putting me there right about the time Nikolai Jakov, head of the KGB, comes home for his borscht, only to find an unexpected dinner guest. Who may be his son. And for de ert, we will have the truth. You hear that, Mother? After a lifetime of your secrets and lies, we will finally have the truth! And also hopefully shitloads of vodka. Woo-hoooo! Parachuuuuuuuuuuuuute!
PILOT: Chief, why's the door still -- wait, don't tell me he just now jumped!
AIRMAN: Yep.

PILOT: You know he mi ed the drop zone by like, eight miles.

PILOT: Jesus... he give you the money?
AIRMAN: Nope.
PILOT: What an a hole.
AIRMAN: Yep. ARCHER: Huh. Hei, jatkat! Tama suomalainen laskuvarjo klubi? I was uh, asking if this was the Finnish Skydiving Club. Which, judging by your response, I a ume it is not. So guys, listen!
BORDER GUARD: What an e hole.
MALORY: He did what? !
GILLETTE: Well for starters... this. That's a broken zygomatic bone, plus I was unconscious for an hour!
LANA: Ooh, really?
GILLETTE: Which is super bad for you!
LANA: Super bad, have you seen a neurologist?
GILLETTE: Have a cat-scan tomorrow.
MALORY: Well unle  it's in Ru ia you'd just better cancel it!
GILLETTE: Well it's obviously not, and what? MALORY: The mi ion you failed was right on the border and I think Sterling might be trying to cro  into Ru ia!
LANA: Why would he -- oh, is this about Nikolai Jakov, the head of the KGB?
MALORY: I -- who?
GILLETTE: Who, nice.
LANA: Right? The man you've been having a forty-year affair with?
MALORY: What are you talking about? !
GILLETTE: Sex, baybee! Let's talk about --
MALORY: Zip it! And even if I did know what you're talking about, how do you know what you're talking ab -- Paaaam!
PAM: I'm not eavesdropping!
MALORY: Get your bloated carca  in here!
PAM: What's up?
MALORY: You disgusting little sneak! Have you been going through my desk? !
PAM: Okay A, nobody cares about your big knobbly vibrating eggplant!
MALORY: Wh-? !
PAM: B, sometimes I work late, and C, there's this new thing the kids are doin, called shuttin the damn door! Foaty ounce in my lap, and it's freezin my jernk...
MALORY: Then I put whipped cream all over everything... And then you know where this goes...
LANA: Eww! Oh shit.
CYRIL: You guys talking about the Whipped Cream Incident?
MALORY: Wh-? Does everyone know about it? !
CHERYL/CAROL: Not everybody. Just us, Krieger... really just the, ya know, core group.
MALORY: Pam, I should have you flensed, and what in God's name do you people want?
CHERYL/CAROL: More rubber cement.
CYRIL: And SIGINT said to give this to you. Radio chatter about an American agent the KGB caught parachuting into Ru ia?
LANA: Oh my God, really? !
CYRIL: Yeah hey, where's Archer?
MALORY: Probably hanging by his Achilles tendons in some KGB hellhole! Caught at border, taken to Vyborg...?! Ray, get your purse and take some Midol, you're going back for him!
GILLETTE: Mmm, according to these notes from my doctor, a radiologist, and my new neurologist, I'm doing no such thing.
MALORY: You little...! Okay, then... Lana!
LANA: Yes?
MALORY: Start at the KGB field office in Vyborg, if he's not being held there go to Saint Petersburg, and if he's not there, you go straight to Moscow!
LANA: Undercover?
MALORY: Wh-? Of course undercover!
LANA: As what, Ru ia's only black woman?
MALORY: Damn it! I can't have this getting blabbed all over the agency, but... oh God, someone has to go rescue my son! Before he talks to Nikolai Jakov!
LANA: Well that someone needs to be fluent in Ru ian, a few contacts in the KGB wouldn't hurt... could, um, this someone be from outside the agency?
BARRY: Noooop!
MALORY: Oh, now I know you two have had your little differences in the past, but --
BARRY: Differences? ! You remeber he shattered my femur! Which is why I'm in New York, by the way, I need all new pins put in it!
MALORY: And I'm sure that must be --
BARRY: Oh! And he sodomized my fiancée!
MALORY: You're still together? ! BARRY: Sorry, ex-fiancée!
MALORY: Well, then it wasn't meant to be.
BARRY: I -- I don't even know how to respond to that.
MALORY: What is meant to be is your going to Ru ia to bring back my son before he does any damage. Or more damage.
BARRY: One million dollars.
MALORY: Well, if you can divide that by four.
BARRY: Wh-? C'mon, this is your son's life! MALORY: And my money. Fifty now, two hundred when you bring him back. Alive.
BARRY: I'll do it on one condition.
LANA: No!
MALORY: Lana, please! LANA: I am not having sex with Barry!
MALORY: You did it once!
LANA: By accident! Mostly.
MALORY: And you were about to, when you thought it would get you my job!
LANA: That was for work! This is just for... Archer.
MALORY: His life may very well depend on it.
LANA: But he's such a douchebag...
MALORY: I know, dear... but he's also my son.
LANA: Not Archer! Well, also very much Archer, but I'm talking about Barry!
BARRY: Who is, in fact, sitting right here. So you wanna do it on the desk, or... hallway, where you wanna knock this out?
LANA: Wherever. After you bring back Archer.
BARRY: Oh no no no. Before.
LANA: After. Non-negotiable.
BARRY: Then can I bring you back anything from Moscow? Maybe some nesting dolls of my penis?
MALORY: Sterling's already in Moscow? !
BARRY: According to ODIN's guy in the KGB. Which, as a real agency, we have.
MALORY: We've got guys in the KGB too, smarty!
BARRY: Yeah, so I hear...
MALORY: Damn that -- Pam! PAM: I'm still not eavesdropping!
MALORY: Well don't just stand here, Sterling's probably being tortured as we speak!
BARRY: Don't worry, he's a high-value a et. I'm sure they're treating him just fine...
ARCHER: So uh, yeah... Kinda wishing I'd taken my training more seriously right about now... Which is uh, pretty rare for me. Hi. [bloodcurdlingly horrifying scream]
ARCHER: I swear I'm just a Finnish skydiving enthusiast who shit why am I speaking English? ! With an American accent!
KGB AGENT: Mebbe becuz you are Sterlink Archer?

ARCHER: Or something a little le  sarcastic? Or le  stupid?
BARRY: Le on one --
ARCHER: Don't "le on one" me Barry!
BARRY: always hide in plain sight. Unle  you've got a better idea...

CHERYL/CAROL: Wow, so this is pretty serious, huh?
LANA: Well, Archer's being tortured with two-to-one odds he ends up brutally murdered, so yes, I'd say it's pretty serious!
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh.
LANA: What.
CHERYL/CAROL: Nothing. PAM: Were you talking about we're out of rubber cement?
CHERYL/CAROL: Yes.
