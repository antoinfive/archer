Archer: SO I GET TO GO TO THE FRENCH RIVIERA ON THE ISIS DIME TO DO WHAT, EXACTLY?
Malory: LOCATE A STOLEN SHIPMENT OF REDEYE MISSILES AND KILL THE ARMS DEALER TRYING TO SELL THEM -- SPYRIDON SKORPIO.
Archer: IS DIABETES BUSY?
Malory: DON'T UNDERESTIMATE SKORPIO. THERE'S A REASON THE BOUNTY ON HIM IS SO HIGH.
Archer: LIKE HIGH ENOUGH TO REDO MY KITCHEN?
Malory: UGH! WHAT DID I TELL YOU?
Archer: THAT SALTILLO TILE IS TERRIBLE FOR A KITCHEN BECAUSE IT'S SO POROUS.
Malory: AND MEXICAN WHOREHOUSE-Y. SO I'M SURE YOUR COOK FEELS AT HOME.
Archer: PITA ISN'T A WHORE!
Malory: NOT UNTIL YOU GOT AHOLD OF HER.
- Archer: FIRST OF ALL -- - Malory: OH, SHUT UP! THE BOUNTY ON SKORPIO IS MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR A NEW KITCHEN.
Archer: I ALSO HAVE THE NOOK --
Malory: AND THE REST YOU CAN SET ASIDE FOR PITA'S INEVITABLE MEDICAL EXPENSES.
Archer: OH, LIKE, ONE TIME THAT HAPPENED! IT'S PRETTY LATE, THOUGH. WHY DON'T YOU, UH, TAKE A CAB?
Pita: [ Mexican accent ] MR. STERLING? I HAVE PROBLEM.
Archer: I'LL PAY FOR IT.
Pita: [ VOMITING ]
Archer: AGAIN? SERIOUSLY, PITA. YOU'RE KILLING ME HERE. AGAIN?! THIS WAS, UH, SUPPOSED TO BE COCONUT SHRIMP. ONE, THREE TIMES. BUT IT'S THE POPE'S FAULT SHE WON'T LET ME WEAR A CONDOM.
Malory: WHY DON'T YOU WEAR A VASECTOMY?!
Archer: THIS AGAIN? DON'T YOU WANT A GRANDKID?
Malory: WELL, IF I DID, I'D JUST SCRAPE ALL YOUR PREVIOUS MISHAPS INTO A BIG PILE AND KNIT A ONESIE FOR IT.
Archer: JESUS CHRIST!
Malory: SORRY, I'VE BEEN FASTING, AND I'M EDGY.
Archer: STILL, THOUGH.
Malory: STERLING!
Archer: OKAY. IF THERE'S MONEY LEFT AFTER THE KITCHEN, THEN VASECTOMY MAYBE.
Malory: SO YOU DO WANT THE ASSIGNMENT.
Archer: YEAH, I WANT IT!
Malory: YOU REALLY, REALLY, REALLY WANT IT?
Archer: YES. I REALLY WANT IT.
Malory: WELL, TOO BAD. BECAUSE GUESS WHAT.
Lana: WOMP-WOMP!
Archer: WHY DOES SHE GET THE MISSION?!
Malory: BECAUSE I SAID SO. EITHER WAY, WE HAVE A PLANE TO CATCH.
Archer: WE?! WHY ARE YOU GOING?
Malory: I'M GOING TO, UM, A CONFERENCE.
Archer: OH, WELL, ISN'T THAT CONVENIENT?
Lana: IF YOU THINK THAT'S CONVENIENT, WAIT TILL YOU SEE MY NEW KITCHEN.
Malory: HA! SERIOUSLY, THOUGH, YOU SHOULD LOOK THROUGH SOME OF HER DESIGN CATALOGS.
Cyril: SO, ZOOM, YOU'RE JUST JETTING OFF TO FRANCE. ISN'T THAT KIND OF SUDDEN?
Lana: NO, BABY. SUDDEN IS WANTING TO MOVE IN WITH SOMEBODY AFTER ONLY FOUR MONTHS.
Cyril: TALKING! JUST TALKING ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW, I MEAN, GEEZ, I MOVED IN WITH MY LAST GIRLFRIEND AFTER FOUR WEEKS.
Lana: WHAT ARE YOU, A LESBIAN?
Pam: WHY? WOULD YOU BE INTO THAT? JUST CURIOUS. WHICH WAS AN ODD WORD CHOICE RIGHT THERE, AND AM I TALKING OUT LOUD?
Malory: NOW REMEMBER. I WANT THE ENTIRE DATA SYSTEM ON THOSE NEW SERVERS, OR I WILL JUST MAKE IT RAIN PINK SLIPS! FEAR IS A POOR MOTIVATOR.
Cyril: LANA, I WANT YOU TO CALL OR TEXT ME AT THE TOP OF EVERY HOUR, AND I'LL CALL OR TEXT AT --
Lana: YEAH, I'M GONNA BE KIND OF BUSY, HON.
Cyril: WELL, IT'S ALL ON THE SCHEDULE.
Lana: OH, NO, HONEY, THE DOORS ARE CLOSING, AND I DIDN'T
- GET THE -- - Archer: OH. SO CLOSE. Lana: SO, YOUR CONFERENCE WOULDN'T BE FOR CONTROL FREAKS WHO HAVE TO MICROMANAGE EVERYTHING, WOULD IT?
Malory: NO! THAT'S NOT WHY I'M -- BUT, LOOK, YOU BE CAREFUL WITH SKORPIO. HE WON'T HESITATE TO KILL YOU.
Lana: UNLESS I GET SMOTHERED TO DEATH FIRST.
Malory: OH, WELL, THAT'S JUST PATHETIC. BUT EVEN THOUGH CYRIL MAY BE CLINGY --
Lana: OH, SARAN WRAP COULD TAKE A LESSON.
Malory: YOU USED TO COMPLAIN CONSTANTLY THAT STERLING WAS EMOTIONALLY DISTANT.
Lana: YEAH. I WAS JUST BEING NICE, THOUGH.
Malory: I WONDER IF HE'S LIKE THAT BECAUSE I USED TO SPANK HIM WITH A WOODEN SPOON.
Lana: UH, YEAH, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. BUT IT MIGHT EXPLAIN THE PING-PONG PADDLE. MERCI!
Malory: MY POINT IS, DEAR, YOU CAN TRUST CYRIL. NOW, YOU GO HAVE A FUN ASSASSINATION.
Lana: UH, OKAY. UH, AND YOU GO HAVE FUN AT YOUR THING.
Malory: OH, I WILL. BYE, DEAR. DID YOU RENT A BOAT? [ Ru ian accent ] DA! IS VERY PRETTY NICE BOAT.
Malory: IT BETTER BE, MR. SEX TAPE. AND YOU, SCUFF THAT LUGGAGE, AND I'LL CUT YOUR HAMSTRINGS FOR YOU.
Pam: YOU KNOW, I THINK WE'RE MAKING SOME PROGRESS. WHERE? IN OPPOSITE WORLD? WE'RE NEVER GONNA FINISH ALL THIS.
Pam: WE CAN IF CERTAIN PEOPLE WOULD HELP.
Krieger: I'M SORRY, ARE YOU ADDRESSING ME? BECAUSE YOUR AUTHORITY IS NOT RECOGNIZED IN FORT KICK-ASS. UGH! MR. ARCHER, YOU COULD HELP.
Archer: HEY, I'M HELPING CYRIL. TEXT HER AGAIN.
Cyril: I AM, IF YOU'D SHUT UP.
Archer: AND REALLY POUR OUT YOUR FEELINGS.
Pam: DON'T LISTEN TO HIM. HE'S JUST TRYING TO --
Archer: SHUT UP! CYRIL, BARE YOUR SOUL. SO, DID I SAY IS NICE BOAT, OR WHAT?
Malory: YES, NIKOLAI, YOU CERTAINLY DID. WHICH HOPEFULLY EXPLAINS MY SHOCK AT FINDING MYSELF ABOARD THE CHUM GUZZLER! [ CHUCKLES ] I AM JUST GETTING THAT.
Malory: WELL, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE NOT GETTING.
Cyril: GIVE IT TO ME!
Pam: NO!
Cyril: PAM, I'M SERIOUS! GIVE ME MY PHONE!
Pam: CYRIL, GODDAMN IT. YOU'RE SMOTHERING LANA.
Cyril: PAM, I WILL HIT YOU IN THE FACE! OW!
Archer: DON'T LISTEN TO HER, CYRIL. YOU KNOW, IF THERE'S ONE THING WOMEN TOTALLY LOVE, IT'S TO BE SMOTHERED BY MEN. [ CHUCKLES ] LIKE YOU'D KNOW.
Archer: OR CHOKED, IN YOUR CASE.
Pam: CYRIL, TRUST ME. GIVE HER SOME SPACE.
Cyril: BUT WHY HASN'T SHE CALLED? I MEAN, WHAT IF SHE'S IN DANGER OR --
Archer: CYRIL, COME ON! WORST-CASE SCENARIO, HER COVER GOT BLOWN, AND SKORPIO'S RAPING HER SENSELESS BEFORE HE CHOPS HER BATTERED CORPSE INTO FISH FOOD.
Cyril: OH, MY GOD.
Pam: WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!
Archer: WHAT? I SAID WORST-CASE. KROSHKÃ¡, LEAVE THAT TO YOUR FIELD AGENT. WHY MUST YOU ALWAYS MICROMANAGE?
Malory: I DON'T! AND IF YOU WILL RECALL, I USED TO BE AN EXCELLENT FIELD AGENT. DA. IS WHY I FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU.
Malory: MY GOD, KOLYA, WE WERE SO YOUNG. YOUNG. AND IN LOVE. AND IN BERLIN.
Malory: ON THAT MAGICAL, MOONLIT NIGHT, BENEATH THE BRIDGE OF SPIES. THE NIGHT BEFORE YOU BREAK MY HEART AND DISAPPEAR FOR NINE MONTHS.
Malory: KOLYA, THERE'S -- THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN MEANING TO TELL YOU. [ SPUTTERS ] WHAT IS IN THIS DRINK?! OH, SORRY. IS ICE FROM COOLER. SOMEHOW IT GOT BUTTER ALL OVER IT. [ WOMAN SCREAMS ] HEY! DON'T BE QUEEN OF DRAMA.
Malory: THAT WASN'T ME, YOU IDIOT! [ WOMAN SCREAMING ] [ GASPS ] OH, DEAR GOD.
Archer: CYRIL, STOP.
Cyril: IT'S LANA. HERE! GIVE ME!
Archer: IT'S MY PHONE. PAM PUT YOURS IN THE BLENDER.
Pam: IT'S CALLED TOUGH LOVE, CYRIL.
Krieger: THE SECRET INGREDIENT IS PHONE.
Archer: MYELLO? MOTHER? WHAT?! REALLY? A-AND YOU'RE SURE IT WAS LANA?
Cyril: WHAT WAS LANA?!
Archer: OKAY, I'M ON IT.
Cyril: COME ON! Archer: WHAT? YES. GOD!
Cyril: WHAT DID SHE SAY?
Archer: WELL, SHE'S STILL REALLY PRO-VASECTOMY.
Cyril: ABOUT LANA!
Archer: OH, RIGHT. YEAH. SO, UH, REMEMBER THAT WORST-CASE SCENARIO WE TALKED ABOUT?
Cyril: OH, MY GOD.
Krieger: YES, I REMEMBER!
Cyril: ARCHER, IF ANYTHING --
Archer: CYRIL, RELAX. I WILL RESCUE HER. SO, KRIEGER, HOW'S ABOUT A ROADIE?
Archer: BECAUSE IT WOULD BE NICE TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF DANGER I'M FACING HERE.
Malory: WHAT DANGER? THEY DO IT OUTPATIENT.
Archer: WHA-- NOT THE VASECTOMY. THE RESCUE.
Malory: HOW WOULD I KNOW? I'M AT A CONFERENCE.
Archer: WAIT A MINUTE.
Malory: YOU DON'T HAVE A MINUTE! NOW, WILL YOU JUST PUT A LID ON IT?!
Archer: ALL RIGHT. I'M GOING. GOD! SHITTY FLYING RATS!
Malory: JUST PUT THE DAMN LID ON IT!
Archer: COMMENCE OPERATION SOMETHING ABOUT I RESCUE LANA AND SHE BEGS ME TO TAKE HER BACK, SO THEN CYRIL COMMITS SUICIDE. SWEAR TO GOD I HAD SOMETHING FOR THIS.
Pam: SERIOUSLY. ARE YOU PEOPLE JUST BAILING ON THIS WHOLE ASSIGNMENT OR WHAT?
Cyril: WHO GIVES A GOSH DAMN ABOUT THAT?! LANA'S CAPTURED, MAYBE EVEN --
Pam: RESCUED! KENNY CRYBABY! COME ON! I BET MR. ARCHER ALREADY WENT ALL DOUBLE-"O"-NINJA ON SKORPIO'S ASS!
Krieger: WHA-CHA! KARATE SOUND.
Cyril: YOU REALLY THINK SO? CYRIL, RIGHT THIS SECOND, I BET HE'S UNTYING LANA, TAKING OFF HER BALL GAG, AND SHE'S LOOKING UP INTO HIS STEELY BLUE EYES AND PARTING HER MOIST LIPS...
Cyril: WAIT A MINUTE.
Pam: YEAH, HANG ON, CRAZY PANTS.
Krieger: LET HER TALK, WOMAN! ...AS HE TAKES HER IN HIS RIPPLING RAMBO-Y ARMS, THROWS HER DOWN...
Cyril: OH, MY GOD! ...AND THEN UNH, UNH!
Cyril: [ CRYING ] YEAH! OH, YEAH! THAT'S RIGHT! GIVE IT TO ME! UNH!
Pam: DAMN IT. LOOK WHAT YOU -- SHOULDN'T YOU BE OFF COOKING A RABBIT SOMEWHERE?
Krieger: I'VE GOT SOME IN THE LAB. I MEAN, MAYBE IT'S NOT THAT. BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.
Cyril: GIVE ME THAT!
Archer: UGH. JESUS, GOD. I THOUGHT I GAVE YOU A FAKE NUMBER.
Cyril: WHAT? ARCHER, IT'S ME.
Archer: CYRIL? HEY, I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.
Cyril: WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD, MR. MAN! NOW, YOU JUST PUT LANA ON THE PHONE.
Archer: WELL, CYRIL, I CAN'T REALLY DO THAT EITHER.
Cyril: UH, HE SAYS HE CAN'T PUT HER ON. [ GASPING ]
Cyril: ARCHER, PUT HER ON THE PHONE!
Archer: CYRIL, BUDDY, LOOK. WHEN I SEE HER, I WILL TELL HER TO CALL YOU. BUT I CAN'T FRICKIN' TALK RIGHT NOW!
Cyril: ARCHER? HELLO? HE HUNG UP. PROBABLY 'CAUSE HE'S ALL... [ GRUNTING ]
Cyril: OH, MY GOD! I CAN'T BREATHE. [ CRYING ]
Archer: [ GURGLING ] [ SCREAMING ]
Cyril: [ CRYING ]
Pam: AND THAT'S THE REASON I DON'T HAVE SEX WITH MY CO-WORKERS. THAT AND NO ONE EVER LETS ME.
Krieger: I'VE HAD GOOD RESULTS WITH ETHER.
Cyril: [ WAILING ]
Archer: [ GURGLING ]
Malory: OH, MY GOD. NIKOLAI, SOMETHING'S WRONG! IT'S JUST FAT DRIPPING FROM KEBABS.
Malory: NOT THAT! KOLYA, MY PEOPLE NEED HELP! DO YOU HAVE ANY KGB AGENTS NEARBY? MEH...
Malory: "MEH" WHAT?! I JUST DON'T FEEL SO COMFORTABLE DISCUSSING KGB OPERATIONS WITH YOU.
Malory: I TELL YOU EVERYTHING! DA. BUT IS A LITTLE... UNPROFESSIONAL.
Archer: SWEAR TO GOD, LANA BETTER BE DEAD ON A SLAB OR BEGGING FOR MERCY OVER A VAT OF ACID OR A SHARK TANK OR -- DRINKING CHAMPAGNE IN A BIKINI?!
Lana: AH, SCREW ME!
Skorpio: [ Greek accent ] TWO MINUTES, MY LOVE! I'M JUST NOW AGAIN RESHAVING MY BALLS AGAIN!
Lana: FIRST OF ALL, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO INTERFERE WITH MY OPERATION! AND NOT THAT IT'S ANY OF YOUR BEESWAX, BUT I DID NOT HAVE SEX WITH SKORPIO!
- Archer: OH, REALLY? - Lana: NO! GOD! I JUST KEPT PUTTING HIM OFF, MAKING HIM RESHAVE HIS BALLS.
Archer: AH. SO YOU CAN HANG OUT ON A BOAT?
Lana: IT'S A MEGA YACHT! AND I JUST -- [SIGHS] I NEEDED A BREAK FROM CYRIL.
Archer: WHO THINKS YOU GOT CAPTURED OR KILLED. WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?
Lana: UM... [ SCREAMING ] [ LAUGHS ] OH, MY GOD! UH, I ACTUALLY FORGET WHAT THAT WAS. I'VE BEEN HITTING THE SAUCE PRETTY HARD.
Archer: JESUS, YOU ARE SO IRRESPONSIBLE.
Lana: OH, REALLY? GO ASK PITA WHO'S IRRESPONSIBLE.
Archer: HEY, SHE KNEW THE JOB WAS RISKY GOING IN. AND SINCE YOU DIDN'T DO YOUR JOB --
Lana: I WILL! ALL RIGHT? JUST GIVE ME, LIKE, A WEEK.
Archer: TOO LATE! YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE, AND YOU BLEW IT. NOW, HOW'S MY DISGUISE?
Lana: UH, IT DEPENDS. WHO ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE, TOPPER BOTTOMS, STERN YET SENSUAL SKIPPER OF THE  U.S.S. ROUGH SERVICE? [ LAUGHS ]
Archer: WHAT? THEY'RE YOUR CLOTHES, IDIOT.
Lana: UGH! DAMN IT. THAT WAS THE GUY IN CHARGE OF THE CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN.
Archer: THERE'S A CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN?
Lana: OH, THERE'S EVERYTHING, GREAT CHAMPAGNE, RIDICULOUS FOOD, A WHOLE, LIKE, SQUAD OF HOT LITTLE FILIPINA MASSEUSES.
Archer: SKEET?
Lana: PROBABLY. AND I JUST REALLY NEED SOME "ME" TIME BEFORE I HAVE TO GO BACK TO CYRIL AND HIS WHOLE --
Archer: CURIOUSLY OPPRESSIVE BRAND OF LOVE?
Lana: I MEAN, COME ON. HAVEN'T I EARNED THAT?
Archer: YES, WE HAVE. I'M STAYING.
Lana: NO!
Archer: YES.
Lana: NO, YOU ARE NOT!
Archer: YES, I AM, OR WOULD YOU PREFER I TELL CYRIL YOU SLEPT WITH SKORPIO?
Lana: [ GASPS ] EVEN YOU WOULDN'T STOOP THAT LOW.
Archer: LANA, COME ON. THIS IS ME. REMEMBER?
Lana: [ GROANS ]
Malory: UNPROFESSIONAL?! FROM THE MAN WHO USED AN ENTIRE KGB SURVEILLANCE TEAM JUST TO MAKE A SEX TAPE OF ME?! [ LAUGHS ] AND ENTIRE KGB ART DEPARTMENT TO AIRBRUSH WRINKLES OFF YOUR OLD ASS.
Malory: I WANT TO LEAVE, PLEASE, RIGHT NOW. SO WHO'S STOPPING YOU? [ GRUNTS ]
Skorpio: MMM. SMILES, EVERYONE. SMILES. FOR THIS PARTY, EVERYTHING MUST BE AS PERFECT AS MY BEAUTIFUL COMPANION.
Lana: [ CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY ]
Skorpio: BECAUSE IN ONE HOUR, THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS TERRORISTS WILL GATHER HERE ON THE AR TO BID ON MY HUMBLE WARES. WAIT! WAIT! YOU! CHOCOLATE-FOUNTAIN GUY, YOU LOOK, UH... DIFFERENT.
Lana: [ GASPS ]
Archer: UM, I GUESS I'VE BEEN WORKING OUT.
Skorpio: YES, I CAN SEE THAT. QUICK, BRING ME SOME DUCT TAPE.
Archer: I, UH --
Skorpio: BECAUSE THIS MALAKA IS RIPPED! [ LAUGHTER ] COME, MY DEAR. BEFORE THE PARTY, I MUST RELAX... ON TOP OF YOU.
Lana: UGH.
Skorpio: NO EXCUSES, EH? MY BALLS ARE SMOOTH.
Lana: AND YOU KNOW I LOVE THAT.
Skorpio: NOT AS MUCH AS I LOVE CHOCOLATE.
Lana: [ SHUDDERS ]
Skorpio: SO YOU, MALAKA, BRING PLENTY OF IT, YES.
Archer: I-I WOULD PREFER NOT TO. "BARTLEBY THE SCRIVENER"? ANYBODY? NOT A BIG MELVILLE CROWD HERE, HUH? HE'S NOT AN EASY READ.
Cyril: AND I DROVE HER RIGHT INTO HIS ARMS. HIS BIG, TAN, MUSCLE-BULGEY ARMS.
Cyril: [ CRYING ]
Pam: CYRIL, COME ON. DON'T LISTEN TO -- WHAT THE HELL'S YOUR NAME NOW, ANYWAY? I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER.
Pam: EXACTLY!
Krieger: [ SNORTING ]
Pam: SO, WHAT YOU SNORTING OFF ME?
Krieger: IT'S MOSTLY MSG.
Pam: THE FLAVOR ENHANCER! WHICH YOU SO NEED.
Pam: PIPE DOWN, PIPE CLEANER! AND, CYRIL, IT'S A RESCUE MISSION, OKAY? PROBABLY FRAUGHT WITH DANGER.
Cyril: YOU REALLY THINK SO?
Pam: I BET THEY'RE FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES.
Lana: WOW.
Archer: YEAH. THAT --
Skorpio: [ CHUCKLES ]
Archer: THAT GOT A LITTLE DARK. Skorpio: SO, NOW WE HAVE CHAMPAGNE, HUH?
Lana: UM, GOT ANYTHING A LITTLE STRONGER?
Archer: OR WAY STRONGER, LIKE POISON?
Skorpio: HMM. I THINK I HAVE JUST THE THING.
Archer: OH, MY GOD!
Skorpio: READY THE SHARK TANK FOR MY GUESTS, AGENTS ARCHER AND KANE, OF ISIS!
Lana: YOU KNEW THE WHOLE TIME?!
Skorpio: HOW YOU SAY... WOMP-WOMP. ALL RIGHT, YOU HEARD MR. SKORPIO.
Skorpio: NO, JUST "SKORPIO." REMEMBER HOW WE'RE DOING THAT FROM NOW ON? SORRY, SIR.
Archer: UH, HANG ON JUST ONE SECOND.
Skorpio: WHERE WAS THIS ENTHUSIASM BEFORE?
Lana: I KNOW, RIGHT? NOW HE WANTS TO CONTRIBUTE.
Archer: [ LAUGHS ] FUNNY. ACTUALLY, I'M GETTING THIS! OH, NO! GRENADE!
Archer: I HAD SOMETHING FOR THIS, TOO. UM...DAMN IT. EAT GRENADE, STUPIDS.
Malory: OH, WELL, NOW WHAT?! UGH! ARE YOU STILL HERE?
Lana: WHERE'D YOU GET A GRENADE?
Archer: HANGING FROM THE LAMPSHADE.
Lana: WAIT. WHAT?
Skorpio: [ COUGHING ] SOULATKA POUTANA!
Lana: WHAT? DID HE JUST CALL ME A WHORE?!
Archer: NOW, WHY ON EARTH WOULD HE DO THAT? BECAUSE HE TURNS WOMEN INTO  WHORES! JUST ASK HIS SLUTTY MEXICAN COOK!
Pam: OH, MY GOD! YES! WE SHOULD CALL HER! BECAUSE I WOULD LITERALLY MURDER SOMEBODY FOR SOME MIGAS RIGHT NOW.
Krieger: EVERY SINGLE NOUN AND VERB IN THAT SENTENCE TOTALLY AROUSES ME.
Pam: AND I AM SO OPEN TO THAT. AND, CYRIL, IGNORE HER. NOTHING'S GOING ON BETWEEN ARCHER AND LANA. ALTHOUGH...
Cyril: "ALTHOUGH" WHAT?
Pam: WELL, EVERY ISIS AGENT HAS A COMPANY-ISSUED LIFE-INSURANCE POLICY. AND, UH...
Cyril: AND WHAT?!
Archer: YOU'RE MY BENEFICIARY!
Lana: YOUR WHAT?!
Archer: ON MY COMPANY LIFE INSURANCE! Lana: OH, MY GOD!
Archer: I MEAN, IF THIS GOES TITS-UP...
Lana: NOW? REALLY?
Archer: OH, RIGHT! BECAUSE YOU WALKED INTO STRIPPERS DISCOUNT WAREHOUSE AND SAID, "HELP ME SHOWCASE MY INTELLECT."
Lana: DISCOUNT?! HELLO! THIS IS FIACCI!
Archer: UH, I THINK IT'S PRONOUNCED "KNOCK-OFF." UNH!
Lana: UGH! RIGHT AFTER I GET BACK, I AM CHANGING THAT STUPID POLICY! UGH! YES, YOU'RE MY BENEFICIARY.
Archer: [ LAUGHS ] HOW'D YOU GET LIFE INSURANCE? DON'T THEY KNOW YOU'RE IN THE DANGER ZONE?
Cyril: BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING. THEY COULD'VE FORGOTTEN TO FILL OUT NEW BENEFICIARY FORMS, OR --
Pam: THEY HAVE TO UPDATE THOSE "BENNIE" FORMS EVERY QUARTER. [ CHUCKLES ] OUCH.
Cyril: BUT THAT MEANS -- OH, MY GOD!
Krieger: DAMN ASS-HAMMERED SHIT!
Pam: WHAT?!
Krieger: BENEFITS! OH, I FORGOT TO SPEND THE BALANCE IN MY GODDAMN FLEX ACCOUNT!
Pam: ARE YOU DATE OF EMPLOYMENT OR --
Krieger: CALENDAR YEAR! OUCH.
Cyril: THAT'S JUST LEAVING MONEY ON THE TABLE. HOW DID YOU FORGET THAT?
Krieger: I GUESS I WAS BUSY FANTASIZING ABOUT ARCHER AND LANA HAVING INTERCOURSE.
Cyril: [ WAILING ] OUCH.
Pam: CYRIL, COME ON, HON. WE ALL WERE.
Archer: AND YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE THAT.
Lana: I DON'T CARE! JUST LIKE I DON'T EVER THINK ABOUT YOU! RELOADING!
Archer: FIRING. SO, WHEN YOU FILLED OUT YOUR INSURANCE FORMS, YOU WEREN'T THINKING ABOUT MY TAN, MUSCULAR ARMS OR MY ASS IN THE COMBAT-FIRING STANCE?
Lana: NO! I WASN'T! I DON'T! I MEAN, I'M --
Archer: SO FULL OF SHIT, YOUR EYES ARE BROWN. NO, THEY'RE -- OH, MY GOD. THEY'RE GREEN. LIKE EMERALDS. HOW DID I NEVER SEE THAT? LANA, YOUR EYES ARE AMAZING.
Lana: ARCHER --
Archer: I MEAN, NOT COMPARED TO YOUR TITS, BUT -- OW! OH! WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?!
Lana: YOU! AND PLUS, I HAVE A BOYFRIEND!
Archer: OH, RIGHT. HOW COULD I FORGET MR. CLING? [ GRUNTING ]
Pam: CYRIL! CYRIL, COME ON! LET GO! [ GRUNTS ] GOD, HE'S STRONGER THAN HE LOOKS!
Krieger: GET HIM OUT OF HERE! BECAUSE THESE CORPORATE BAGMUNCHERS OWE ME $630 FOR MY GODDAMN FLEX ACCOUNT!
Archer: UGH! I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU SHOT ME! YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I HATE THAT!
Lana: YEAH, WELL, YOU BETTER GET USED TO IT!
Skorpio: KILL THEM, YOU FOOLS! KILL THEM!
Lana: OH, MY GOD. I AM GONNA DIE, AND YOU ARE THE LAST MAN I WAS IN BED WITH.
Archer: WELL, ONE OF THEM. DON'T WORRY. I WON'T TELL CYRIL. PROBABLY.
Lana: SHIT! I'M OUT OF AMMO! ARCHER!
Archer: LANA! LANA, DO YOU TRUST ME?!
Lana: WHAT? NO! I DON'T TRUST YOU!
Archer: WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD. BECAUSE GUESS WHAT.
Malory: OH, MY GOD! NIKOLAI! OUR SON! OUR WHAT?!
Malory: OH, SO, REMEMBER THAT LITTLE SOMETHING I WANTED TO TELL YOU? A "LITTLE SOMETHING"? OH, THAT IS JUST CLASSIC YOU!
Malory: SO I'M A LITTLE LATE. A LOT LATE! NO ONE COULD HAVE SURVIVED THAT.
Archer: OH, MAN! WHOO! I AM AWESOME!
Lana: UGH, AND IT JUST KEEPS ON GETTING BETTER.
Archer: LANA?!
Lana: ASSHOLE?
Archer: OH, MY GOD. [ COUGHS ] WAS THAT NOT EPIC?
Lana: FIRST OF ALL --
Malory: NIKOLAI, LOOK. THEY'RE ALIVE! OH, THANK GOD! THANK GOD?! FOR WHAT?! THE LYING WOMAN I RISKED MY CAREER FOR? THE SON SHE DON'T TOLD ME OF? OR MAYBE MY DAMN SECURITY DEPOSIT?
Malory: PSH! SECURITY DEPOSIT. WHAT WAS IT, A PAIR OF FLIP-FLOPS?
Archer: HALF THE BOUNTY. COME ON, I DESERVE IT.
Lana: HA! TOO BAD! SO YOU CAN JUST PADDLE THAT HOLE IN YOUR FOOT RIGHT ON BACK TO YOUR CHEESY MEXICAN KITCHEN.
Archer: OH, I'LL GET A NEW KITCHEN. BUT LET'S SEE YOU GET A NEW BOYFRIEND AFTER I HAVE A LONG TALK WITH CYRIL.
Lana: HA! ABOUT WHAT, EXACTLY? HOW YOU CRIED DURING A TWO-MAN THREESOME?
Archer: WOODEN SPOONS ARE A HUGE EMOTIONAL TRIGGER FOR ME, LANA.
Lana: YEAH, AND NOW I KNOW. AND WHEN I TELL PAM, SO WILL EVERYBODY IN THE OFFICE!
Archer: OH, IS THAT HOW YOU WANT TO PLAY IT?
Lana: YEP!
Archer: FINE! KEEP YOUR STUPID BOUNTY, THEN. AND KEEP YOUR PATHETIC, CLINGY BOYFRIEND.
Lana: I WILL! OH, AND CYRIL MAY BE CLINGY, BUT AT LEAST I KNOW I CAN TRUST HIM!
Cyril: OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD! CYRIL, COME ON. SNAP OUT OF IT. SERIOUSLY. IT'S NOT LIKE WE BURNED DOWN THE MAINFRAME. YOU REALLY NEED TO RELAX.
Cyril: HOW?! MY LIFE IS RUINED! AGAIN! LOOK, WHAT HAPPENS ON THIS SCRATCHY GREEN OFFICE RUG STAYS ON THIS SCRATCHY GREEN OFFICE RUG, OKAY?
Cyril: YOU MEAN THIS, WHAT WE JUST DID... YOU'LL KEEP THIS OUR SECRET? YEAH. GOD! CYRIL, YOU CAN TRUST ME. YOU KNOW, PROBABLY.
Cyril: WHA-- PROBABLY?! WOMP-WOMP.
