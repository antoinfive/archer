ARCHER: Are you shitting me?! How can they do that?! And do you have to do that right goddamn now?!
KRIEGER: I actually don't have to do it ever.
CYRIL: And so I ask again, why are you?!
KRIEGER: Mm-m.
ARCHER: How can they seize my penthouse?!
MALORY: Well A, they're the government, and B, ISIS owned that penthouse, so -
ARCHER: Since when?
MALORY: Since this new thing called always? It never struck you as odd that you lived there for ten years and never paid a dime in rent?!
ARCHER: I just thought it was because I banged the landlord's wife when she dropped off the key. But I realize now that I was mistaken.
LANA: Aw, what a scary new feeling for you.
ARCHER: Not as scary as having to live in Casa de Addams Family with you two!
MALORY: Ugh, no, I'm just working here, not moving in. I was smart enough to put my apartment in Ron's name.
LANA: We all could've hidden our a ets if you'd warned us we were about to be arrested for treason!
MALORY: Oh for the love, how long are you going to throw that in my face? !
LANA: Probably at least through the weekend.
MALORY: Well, then you'll have to throw it from Miami.
LANA: Wait, no, why, what's in -- [ BEEP BEEP BEEP! ]
LANA: -- Miami.
MALORY: Besides ninety percent of all mosquitoes and Cubans on earth?
ARCHER: That sounds high.
MALORY: A buyer for twenty kilos of our cocaine.
LANA: Okay, now you sound high. [ BRAWMP! ]
MALORY: And what did I say about that horn? !
PAM: Oh, you were serious?
MALORY: Did I not look serious? !
LANA: Well maybe she couldn't tell, because you seemed pretty serious just now, when you said you set up a drug deal.
MALORY: How else are we supposed to sell it? It's not like we can have a yard sale.
ARCHER: Yeah, Lana. Hello, people would steal it?
LANA: I realize. We can't have a yard sale.
ARCHER: Plus it's illegal?
LANA: My point. Is how did you, Malory, po ibly, set up a major drug deal?
MALORY: Oh, don't worry about that...
LANA: Kinda feel like I should.
MALORY: Just worry about not screwing up this deal, because if it all goes well, my contact's people may buy the rest. And the sooner we sell this cocaine, the sooner we'll all be set for life.
ARCHER: And the sooner we can move out of this enormous, Gilded Age mansion. Which -- where the hell is Woodhouse?
PAM: In the pool.
WOODHOUSE: Hello? I've finished!
ARCHER: Jesus Christ, how long does it take him to move in?
MALORY: And so, the sooner you go to Miami...
LANA: Oh, I'm sorry, lemme eat forty pounds of coke-filled rubbers, and we're off.
MALORY: Don't be ridiculous -
ARCHER: Hello, pregnant?
MALORY: -- Dr. Krieger has devised a way to transport the cocaine undetected.
KRIEGER: Oh, you were serious?
MALORY: Wh-? God! Dammit!
KRIEGER: Sometimes it's hard to tell with you!
MALORY: And since Carol insists on keeping Ms. Gillette here as a voice coach...
CHERYL/CAROL: Do, re, mi, fa, so, la, teeeeee!
GILLETTE: No no no no no! Again!
CHERYL/CAROL: Do -
ARCHER: And also since he's crippled...
MALORY: And also since he's crippled, Pam -- [ BRAWMP! ]
MALORY: will be going with you.
PAM: Kinda like the third Musketeer, huh? !
MALORY: Kinda.
ARCHER: Hey Pam, relax, breathe you're doing fine... But since that, um, special "plaster" in your cast can totally be absorbed through the skin, you're probably gonna wanna try to minimize the sweating. Yeah, just think cool thoughts. Like eating mint chocolate chip ice cream. In your refrigerated drawer. At the morgue.
CHERYL/CAROL: Do, re, mi, fa --
GILLETTE: No! Again!
MALORY: My God, how I envy the deaf. I hope you're a better lawyer than she is a singer.
CYRIL: I'd have to be. And I will be, I'm pretty darn excited to be practicing law again. I mean, hopefully I won't have to defend anybody in court, but --
MALORY: But there's always a district attorney to blackmail, a witne  to coerce, a judge to bribe...
CYRIL: Bribe with what? The government seized the ISIS accounts, we're broke.
MALORY: Hopefully not for long. And when that drug money starts pouring in, you'll be in charge of laundering.
CYRIL: I'll start looking for a laundromat.
MALORY: Wh-? Money laundering, you a ! Oh, you mean as a front, because a laundromat is a cash-based busine . Why don't I just leave that whole side of the organization to you?
CYRIL: Only if you promise to periodically micromanage it. And emasculate me.
MALORY: Cyril, I would have thought that goes without saying.
ARCHER: Ugh! It smells like a skunk ape!
LANA: Yeah, I'm hoping the mattre es are just mildewy, and not... Mildewy and dead-hookery.
ARCHER: No, not the room. These.
PAM: Casts smell bad when you take 'em off it's a thing people know about!
ARCHER: Yeah after six weeks, not six hours!
LANA: So listen, about this deal...
ARCHER: Hang on. Pam, chop chop, torso! Ugh, this smells like a kennel, but for dogs that are poor.
LANA: Archer!
ARCHER: What, smell it.
LANA: Shut up, look your mother's got the time in here, the place, price per kilo... But there's nothing about her contact, no picture, not even a name? What if this "person" is really a biker gang?
ARCHER: Who gives a shit? Hang on. Legs! Lana, you and I, more me, were two of the best secret agents in the world...
LANA: We were rogues.
ARCHER: Potato, puh-treason, whatever, but we've been up against terrorists, a a ins, the KGB, the IRA remember, North Korea, cyborgs, help me out...
LANA: Space pirates...
ARCHER: Oh my God, I forgot about the space pirates! But the point is, we are highly trained covert operatives with an extremely dangerous set of skills -- Pam, legs! -- and since the government has unjustly accused us of treason, we are now forced to transfer those skills from espionage to criminal activity, kind of like the A-Team, but we sell drugs.
LANA: And you're okay with that.
ARCHER: Are you not? ! Lana, it's the A-Team meets Scarface! That makes me...
LANA: Hannibal Montana?
ARCHER: What the--? Pam? ! Goddammit, tell me you're not -- Pam ! Stop eating it, dammit !
LANA: Pam? Archer?
PAM: He's okay! He's okay don't come in here don't come in here he's okay!
LANA: Oh shit.
PAM: What, I said don't come in here!
LANA: No, Leon!
LANA: No, I'm honestly not judging you...
PAM: Really, so this super-judgy feeling I'm feeling is just me feeling like you're super-judgy and that's me? !
LANA: So, um, are you hearing your words?
PAM: Are you shitting me? I can't hear anything over my har -- tbeat, yerp, fired back up boop!
LANA: It's just we're like, two days into this whole drug cartel thing, and you're already addicted to cocaine.
PAM: Oh okay so I should take life advice from an unwed mother? ! With a dirty car? !
PAM: Is he dead?
LANA: No.
PAM: He looks dead. LANA: He's not.
PAM: I think he's dead.
LANA: Pam?
LATINO VOICE: Mis amigas, por favor!
ARCHER: Unghh...
PAM: Is he a zombie?
LANA: Pam!
LATINO VOICE: Sterling? Sterling can you hear me?
ARCHER: Ramón? !
RAMON: Sí, mi amigo, soy yo!
LANA: Wh-? You two know each other? !
ARCHER: Sh-shut your h-hole, am I d-dying?
RAMON: No, amigo, estas bien!
ARCHER: But I'm s-so, c-co -- oh. Um...
RAMON: She insisted.
PAM: So we could unfreeze you in the future, once medical science had developed a cure for... headsmash.
ARCHER: And you...
LANA: Acquiesced. She's all... coke-strong.
RAMON: So yes, I am your mother's contact. After Fidel's hitmen try to kill me --
ARCHER: Ugh, Charles and Rudi, those dicks. I wonder what ever happened to --
RAMON: Anyway! I go into hiding, change my name, buy this busine  with some little money I borrow from Mamá, and --
ARCHER: Hey, how is your mother?
RAMON: Pff, como siempre. Y la tuya?
CHERYL/CAROL: Do, re -- [ BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM! ]
CHERYL/CAROL: Jesus! Alright already!
MALORY: Thank you.
ARCHER: Como siempre.
RAMON: So, she telephone me, ask if I know some maybe people, I say yes, I know some maybe people, and here we are.
LANA: And, sorry, you're getting out of this maybe what?
ARCHER: Lana! He's helping a dear friend!
RAMON: Sí, claro. And also how you say, a finder's fee? Five thousand a kilo.
ARCHER: Oh.
RAMON: Because I want to buy that place...
EVERYBODY: [ Gasps ]
RAMON: Nice, eh? Is the best club in Miami.
ARCHER: Uh, duh! You need investors? !
LANA: Archer, what're you --
ARCHER: Lana, we're gonna need an office in Miami, and that office is gonna need to be a red leather banquette!
RAMON: Dios mío, that would be increíble! You and me, together at last...
LANA: Implying that you two haven't ever, cough, been together, or...?
ARCHER: It was a mi ion, Lana! Ramón's Latino, so he's comfortable expre ing affection! It doesn't make him gay!
RAMON: Although I am.
ARCHER: So go ahead, Lana, judge away!
PAM: Right?
LANA: I -- Pam shut up, and Archer you know better, I don't care about that. What I do care about are these buyers of yours, Ramón. Who are they?
RAMON: Just some guys. We'll go see them, they're cool, dun't worry about it.
LANA: Kinda feel like I should.
ARCHER: Lana, Ramón vouches for them, I vouch for him, and you're embarra ing me!
LANA: I am.
PAM: Kachoooo!
LANA: That's flour, by the way. PAM: I know.
CHERYL/CAROL: Don't you think I know that? ! I know it's bad, I'm not ear-crippled!
GILLETTE: Well, then maybe being a c --
CHERYL/CAROL: Not a, the number one country music singer in all of America, and some of Canada!
GILLETTE: Well, what if maybe that goal's not realistic? Or even unlaughable?
CHERYL/CAROL: Get out!
ARCHER: Wait, seriously?
RAMON: Yes, they were very clear, no guns.
ARCHER: But --
RAMON: I gave mi palabra.
ARCHER: Right, sorry, I -- LANA: Archer.
ARCHER: Lana he gave his palabra!
LANA: If anything goes wrong I'm holding you responsible.
ARCHER: Yeah, that'll teach me.
CYRIL: Tough day, huh?
GILLETTE: The high point was getting shot at.
CYRIL: It's so weird, I mean, she's a billionaire, she could be anything, a world traveler, an art collector...
GILLETTE: A transatlantic goddamn balloonist!
CYRIL: So, why does she want to be a country singer so badly? Besides being clinically insane.
GILLETTE: Yeah. Here's to the crazy ones.
CYRIL: Um...
RAMON: Ugh, díos mio, that stinks!
PAM: It's not that bad! I mean it's not great, but... This is still some primo shit.
ARCHER: Pam! Quit eating all the goddamn cocaine!
CHARLES: Yeah, save some for us, bitches!
ARCHER: Charles and Rudi? !
LANA: Wait, the hitmen? !
RAMON: Tranquilo, tranquilo! It's okay!
CHARLES: Yeah, we're like BFF's now.
ARCHER: What? !
RAMON: Well...
CHARLES: Or whatever, here's your fondue set, and... was there only one blue fork?
ARCHER: What the hell? !
CHARLES: And how is that tone nece ary?
RUDI: Thank you.
CHARLES: It's a fork.
RAMON: And there were two of each color and you know this as well as me because we stood in my kitchen and counted.
CHARLES: Well then I apologize, and I'll be happy to throw in another... five dollars?
RAMON: Eighty dollars.
CHARLES: For a fork? !
RAMON: You can't buy only one blue fork, you have to buy the whole set!
CHARLES: Oh, that is such -- okay okay, ya know what? Fine. We'll call it one million and eighty dollars!
RAMON: Well, there is a small problem there.
CHARLES: What, we agreed on fifty grand a kilo! And fifty times twenty --
LANA: I think we're probably a little closer to nineteen and a half?
CHARLES: Okay, couple Q's, I'd love some A's. One, what the hell is that thing?
ARCHER: We made a body cast out of the coke.
RAMON: But I tested it, it's very pure.
CHARLES: Mmkay, two, how can you eat a pound of cocaine and not be dead?
PAM: I've actually never felt better! I hope that lasts.
CHARLES: I'm sure it will, okay here's the dilly and the sweets. We're gonna round that down to nineteen kilos even, so I'll just take back fifty grand...
ARCHER: Way to go, Pam.
CHARLES: And since the coke's in the shape of a Poppin' Fresh costume, and taintsweaty, I'm taking off another fifty...
ARCHER: The hell you are!
CHARLES: Can I finish? Can I finish? Since Ramón gave his word that you people wouldn't bring any guns...
ARCHER: We didn't, not even my underwear gun.
RAMON: I gave mi palabra.
CHARLES: Well that's just terrific. Because... You dum-dums, we're gonna go ahead and take the cocaine and the money.
ARCHER: Goddammit.
LANA: And so, right about here is the part where I hold you responsible.
ARCHER: Oh my God the burden.
RUDI: Make sure you take the fondue set
CHARLES: Can I finish? ! And I'll take the fondue set. Because you were a total b-hole about the fork. It's not even real Le Creuset!
LANA: Ugh!
RAMON: Right? Of course it is real.
ARCHER: Ramón?
RAMON: Just because it's from the outlet store doesn't mean --
ARCHER: Ramón!
RAMON: What? Sterling, are you angry with me? Wait, you don't think this is my fault? !
RAMON: Sterling, please! This is loco!
ARCHER: No, Ramón, getting my stolen money back isn't loco, it's -- Wait, what's the word for rational?
RAMON: Racional.
ARCHER: Goddammit.
LANA: What was loco was trusting you!
RAMON: How can you say that? !
ARCHER: To Ramón, Of all people!
LANA: Look, I don't know what kind of "history" you two have together, but --
ARCHER: History? ! What're you trying to -- that's crazy, we didn't even ki !
PAM: Zip!
ARCHER: Do you even hear how crazy you sound?
LANA: Do you? !
ARCHER: I dunno, yes, shut up. Ramón, I'm sorry but this whole thing is kinda your fault, so you're taking us to wherever Charles and Rudi are having a money fight with our million bucks.
RAMON: A million and eighty.
ARCHER: Alright, uno rampageeo! Okay, Lana,
LANA: Votes we cut our lo es and go home. While reminding you, seemingly unnece arily, that she is pregnant.
ARCHER: Oh my God, how long are you gonna use that for an excuse?
LANA: Probably at least through childbirth.
ARCHER: Oh, you were serious?
MALORY: Alright, I'm going home, but -- What's her problem?
CYRIL: Scotch. And also maybe post-traumatic stre  disorder, from listening to --
CHERYL/CAROL: 40 miles of mountain road...
MALORY: Carol?
KRIEGER: Yep yep yep!
MALORY: But... how is that po ible?
KRIEGER: I've got the whole house wired up. Bedrooms, bathrooms, bathrooms, other bathrooms, the swimming pool...
MALORY: I meant! A !
KRIEGER: Ow!
MALORY: How is she singing so... well?
KRIEGER: Probably because she doesn't know anyone's watching. You'd be amazed what you people do when you think you're alone. Cyril.
CYRIL: Wh-? Dammit Krieger, you -- ow!
MALORY: Turn it up!
CHERYL/CAROL: 40 miles of Gerogia clay...
ARCHER: Oh my God. This is exactly how I pictured their house.
RAMON: Oh, wait until you see inside, díos mio, they just redid the kitchen.
LANA: Ahem.
ARCHER: What, just because you have no taste.
LANA: Or patience, so if you could hurry up and get our money --
PAM: And cocaine and cocaine get the cocai -- [ BLOOP. ]
PAM: Oh my God Lana, Lana, you know what I could totally go for right now? !
LANA: Some cocaine?
PAM: Right? !
PAM: Popety, pop pop pop, pow.
RAMON: Did I tell you? Here, give me your gun. Now push that button, right there.
ARCHER: This is the best kitchen ever!
CHARLES: Aww mercy, thank you... Ya know, if we could go back in time there's a few things we'd change...
ARCHER: Goddammit...
CHARLES: But overall we're pretty happy. Even though it's gonna be a bitch to scrub your brains out of the grout.
RAMON: Charles, por favor! You have your cocaine, just give them their money!
CHARLES: Oh okay sure, we've got it right here.
ARCHER: Oh! Great, yes, and we've got about a five hour flight home, with Pam...
PAM: Poppety pop pop, cocaine.
ARCHER: So can you throw in a pound of coke?
CHARLES: Can I? ! I only totally insist!
ARCHER: Oh. So, you're being facetious.
CHARLES: Extra-eemly, yes. A, the coke is gone...
RAMON: What? ! What do you mean, gone? !
CHARLES: Not gone gone, you-know-who has it --
ARCHER: Wh-? ! Ramón? ! Who is you-know-who? !
RAMON: I, uh --
CHARLES: You still get your cut, 'cuz you-know who says good job on you-know-what!
ARCHER: What? !
RAMON: Por qué no te callas? !
ARCHER: Ramón! [ GUNFIRE ]
ARCHER: Ramón!
RAMON: Sterling... díos mio, I'm... sorry.
LANA: Sorry baby sorry baby sorry baby...
PAM: Lanaaa! get cocaaaaaaine!
RAMON: Oh, Sterling, I'm s-so c-cold...
ARCHER: What, like hearted? Ramón, what the hell, was this all a scam, or --
RAMON: No, I swear, is just muy complicado. Sorry, I cannot explain right now.
ARCHER: Oh really? ! Why, because you're -- Dying, right, sorry.
RAMON: Take the money, God knows you've earned it. All I ask, is one small favor... Before I die.
ARCHER: Yes, Ramón, I'll do anything!
LANA: You name it kid, savings bond, a puppy, breastfeed you sensele ... just forgive me for what's about to happen.
LANA: So, um, quick question...
MALORY: Why the hell were you ki ing him? !
LANA: With what appeared to be tongue...
ARCHER: Because, I -- it was muy complicado Lana! And the last wish of a dying man!
LANA: Who you had a crush on.
ARCHER: I -- no, I -- go smoke some menthols!
MALORY: Alright, Sterling, calm down. My God, it's not as if I care. As long --
ARCHER: As long as I brought back the money! Is that what you were going to say? !
MALORY: Yes. And I don't have time for this, I have a country music star to manage.
CHERYL/CAROL: Says you!
MALORY: Says your contract, mi y! Read it!
CHERYL/CAROL: You read it! Goddammit.
CYRIL: And, I'm sorry, the money is where, exactly?
ARCHER: Uh, in your masturbators, you idiot.
CYRIL: Oh, I'm the idiot?
ARCHER: I mean, historically...
CYRIL: Well I'm not the one who sold twenty kilos of coke for... Monopoly money!
EVERYBODY: Huh? What?
CYRIL: It's counterfeit! Every last bill!
MALORY: Son of a...! Sterling, you fool, was this was all just a huge set up!
ARCHER: For what mother, a funeral? ! They're all dead!
LANA: Yeah, but... are they?
LANA: We got out of there in a hurry...
ARCHER: Ramóoooon!
LANA: Will you come on? !
ARCHER: But the gunshots... all the blood.
LANA: Blood packs and blanks.
ARCHER: Even Ramón?
LANA: Especially Ramón. I bet the whole thing was his idea.
ARCHER: Aha! You're forgetting a key piece of the puzzle, Lana! They'd already stolen our coke, and they had the money! Why go to the trouble of a fake shootout? !
CHARLES: See what I'm saying?
RAMON: But this way, we have twenty kilos of pure, uncut, Colombian cocaine.
CHARLES: Holy shit, yes! Which we had already stolen, so we still would've had it! Plus the counterfeit million dollars, which now we don't have!
RAMON: Ohhhhh...
CHARLES: Like, fifty times I tried to explain this!
RAMON: I see now, what you were saying.
CHARLES: Ta-daaaaa! Jesus, it's like trying to explain particle physics to... a particle.
RAMON: Aha! But this way, my way, Archer thinks we are dead, so he will never think to come looking for us again!
CHARLES: It was still a stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid plan.
